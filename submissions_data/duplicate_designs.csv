We converted it to a peptidomimetic molecule with a Michael acceptor for covalent bonding to Cys145 and docked it onto 6y2e PDB using rosetta ligand docking. The approximate ligand docking protocol is as follows, 
1. First we used SiteHound to identify posssible ligand binding sites in 6y2e using a Methyl probe. Three binding sites were found but only the active site showed the highest score qualifying for the subsequent docking run. 
2. The ligand was placed close to 6y2e at the XYZ coordinates obtained for high scoring solution from SiteHound. 10,000 docking poses were generated by restricting the ligand to a box of 10 Å radius and perturbing (rotation + translation) the ligand 5 Å. Rosetta calculated the interface_delta score which is approximate measure of the interaction between the ligand and the protein. Top 10 solution sorted using interface_delta score were manually inspected in pymol. All 10 solutions docked the ligand in the active site.
Key Features of the docked pose are:
- The peptidomimetic molecule contains two phenylalanines and one arginine. 
- The Michael acceptor is placed close to C145 for covalent bond formation
- The N-term Phe occupies hydrophobic pocket formed by residues H41, M49, F140, H163
- The C-term Phe occupies hydrophobic pocket formed by residues M165, L167, F185 and V186
- Arg forms a salt-bridge to E166 and another polar contact to the backbone carbonyls of residues L167 and P168. 

The ligand buries a total surface area of ~ 500 Å^2.

With this aim, we took from e-Drug3D (https://chemoinfo.ipmc.cnrs.fr/MOLDB/index.php) all the 1930 molecular structures approved between 1939 and 2019 by the FDA with a molecular weight ≤ 2000 Da and docked them at the binding site of 6LU7 structure by using three different docking programs (i.e., GlideSP, FRED and VINA). For each ligand and docking program, we have kept the top 10 docked poses (i.e., 10 for GlideSP, 10 for FRED and 10 for VINA). When considering 10 poses per ligand/program we assume that one of them will be the bioactive one (although the score function not always have ranked it as the first one). Finally the bioactive pose is assumed to be identified if it has been found simultaneously by the three programs (this means that the rmsd for each pairwise pose comparison is below 1.5 angstroms). Our idea here is that, in general, protein-ligand docking programs are really good when trying to look for the possible poses of a ligand in a binding site but usually fail to rank correctly such poses. Then, if three different protein-ligand programs find the same pose, this have a high probability to be the bioactive one.

Then, we applied a second filter in order to keep only those poses that are not only identified by the three programs but also show high affinity for M-pro. In order to find which threshold can be used to discriminate high from low affinity poses, we docked the 1577 compounds from the OTAVA Machine Learning SARS Targeted Library (https://otavachemicals.com/targets/sars-cov-2-targeted-libraries?utm_medium=email&utm_source=UniSender&utm_campaign=229613803) into the binding site of 6LU7 with GlideSP, FRED and VINA (with the identical set up conditions than were previously used for the 1930 FDA approved compounds). For this docking, we kept only the top-ranked pose obtained for each ligand by each programs. Then, we make three different histograms for the docking results of the OTAVA library (one per program) and arbitrarily selected as a threshold for distinguish from low to high M-pro affinity the lowest score value of the interval that contains the top 30% poses with the highest affinity. The resulting threshold was -6.3 for GlideSP, -7.0 for FRED and -7.5 for VINA. Then, all the poses that had succeed the first filter but had scores more positive than these threshold values were removed.

Then, only 5 FDA approved compounds simultaneously accomplished that: (1) the same pose is found independently by GlideSP, FRED and VINA; and (2) this pose has score values equal or more negative than the three mentioned thresholds.

This submission corresponds to one of these five compounds: CARPROFEN",x0072

# Notes on the chemical profile:
#
# Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released to the PDB by von Grelft group) served as starting
# scaffolds for redesign with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign. The variation of this algorithm 
# utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand 
# interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step
# to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. The best optimizations by QSAR/QSPR analysis
# are recombined with BCL::LinkFragments, an in-development combinatorial chemistry algorithm. Again, molecules are optimized for clash resolution and
# interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to
# intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex
# is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring
# pose.
#
# Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained 
# in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation)
# scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using 
# either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics
# of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well.
# RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy
# units (REU). MoleculeComplexity is a metric by Ertl. et al., 2009, Journal of Cheminformatics, and generally less than 2.5 indicates the molecule is
# reasonably synthesizable.

that makes sense based on an evodevoeco approach to the coronas in a combinatorial and comparative framwework 
morover they coevolved and can be produced fast with GMP and  isolated in relatively large amounts and high purity from staple crops and from biorests  

 they do dock quite well with 6lu7  (CASP) and makes sense in a evodevo context of the coronaviruses ( broad spectrum)  is now in a clinical double blind crossover study 

 the factory set up is ready in at lest three countries once the initial  study( last crossover was interfered by the outbreak in Spain but last crossover nacebo /placebo group we will also with an will also be offerd IgM and IgG kits) 

 but the same line of reasoning goes here  a prepared nes for that this is evolution in real time as well as a need to know a bit more if some of these especially natural compound can scale well it also can be done more efficient and serve as substrates for new compounds and synbio pathway redesigns/scaffolds

We also have some  peptides with O and N glyosylation /moieties and modification which might serve as boosting based on stable epitopes  of the M in nCOV but are not sure if that is on your agenda ?

Starting from biarylurea structure Mpro-x0434, the idea was to cyclize to rigidify the urea moiety.  This can be done in different ways but the best-looking scaffold seems to be a pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione scaffold. It keeps the nitrogens and carbonyl of the urea in place with the carbonyl making a hydrogen bond to Glu166 backbone NH as seen in the original fragment; plus it introduces another hydrogen bind with Gly143 NH. This design is the smallest of the submissions.

The next step is to annulate the scaffold with another benzene ring resulting in a Phenylquinazoline-2,4-dione (PAQ) scaffold. This scaffold is described in literature in Nakagawa et al., Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry, 16(14) 7046-7054, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2008.05.016 although not with a di-aromatic connection.
Introducing a Cl or Br in position 7 on the scaffold leads to a halogen bond with Cys44 C=O backbone. Cl is a weaker halogen bond donor than Br so the 6-F is introduced to tune the halogen bond in the case of Cl (can of course also be done with Br).",x0434

x0107, x0540 and x0995 all shared a common pyridine ring co-crystallized in the same region. Using this and building from x0107, I built out from the amide group to occupy the pocket like space extending from this position. I used Cresset software's Flare tool, employing in silico docking, iteratively improving the binding score whilst also the ligand complementarity to the binding region. The methyl-OH group displaces a water molecule as well as the pyrrole/pyrazole groups. I am sorry I can't comment on the synthetic ease or routes.","x0107,x0540,x0995"
