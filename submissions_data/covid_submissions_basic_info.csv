#
# Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released to the PDB by von Grelft group) served as starting
# scaffolds for redesign with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign. The variation of this algorithm 
# utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand 
# interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step
# to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. The best optimizations by QSAR/QSPR analysis
# are recombined with BCL::LinkFragments, an in-development combinatorial chemistry algorithm. Again, molecules are optimized for clash resolution and
# interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to
# intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex
# is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring
# pose.
#
# Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained 
# in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation)
# scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using 
# either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics
# of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well.
# RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy
# units (REU). MoleculeComplexity is a metric by Ertl. et al., 2009, Journal of Cheminformatics, and generally less than 2.5 indicates the molecule is

# either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics
# of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well.
# RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy
# units (REU). MoleculeComplexity is a metric by Ertl. et al., 2009, Journal of Cheminformatics, and generally less than 2.5 indicates the molecule is
# reasonably synthesizable.

O=C(CC1CCCCC1)Nc1cncc2[nH]ccc12,SID-ELM-2583a2cd-1,"Sidney Elmer, Elmer","The P1 binding pocket is an intriguing region of the Mpro enzyme to target. In the fragment screen, many fragments bound in this location, with a hydrogen bond between the ligand and the epsilon nitrogen of HIS163. There are three examples of fragments with a 3-pyridine moiety (x0107, x0434, and x0678) and an additional closely related fragment with a pyrimidine (x0995). The pattern is obsured a little bit with other functional groups (i.e. x0426 and x0540 with 4-pyridine, and x0967 with a phenol) distracting from the 3-pyridine motif. For example, the 4-pyridine fragments could be useful except that the side groups extend into the solvent, making the 3-pyridine the preferred binding motif. x0995 presents an example fragment with an aniline-NH2 group in a beneficial location, a highly polar region where the N-terminal SER1 from chain B interacts with ASP142 and the backbone of PHE140. Also, x1093 offers an example of a larger ring system for increasing the surface contact area and the potential for additional polar and/or hydrogen bonding interactions to further increase the affinity of a piece of the drug molecule at this region of the binding pocket.

Another interesting feature of this fragment screen is the similarity of binding pose between x0678 and x0434. The 3-pyridine side of the molecules are exactly the same and bind almost identically to the protein. The opposite side of the molecules differ, with each offering advantages or disadvantages for further exploration. Therefore, I am proposing a set of compounds based on the x0434 and x0678 fragments with varying extensions to the 3-pyridine motif. These compounds all maintain the hydrogen bond acceptor with the epsilon nitrogen of HIS163 and incorporate a nitrogen, either exocyclic as demonstrated with x0995 or incorporated into larger 6+5 or 6+6 bicyclic heteroaromatic rings, to interact with the N-terminus of chain B. These compounds offer varying protonation states and angles for interacting with this key region of the enzyme.","x0107,x0434,x0678,x0995,x1093",https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/SID-ELM-2583a2cd

In the fragment screen, many fragments bound in this location, with a hydrogen bond between the ligand and the epsilon nitrogen of HIS163. There are three examples of fragments with a 3-pyridine moiety (x0107, x0434, and x0678) and an additional closely related fragment with a pyrimidine (x0995). The pattern is obsured a little bit with other functional groups (i.e. x0426 and x0540 with 4-pyridine, and x0967 with a phenol) distracting from the 3-pyridine motif. For example, the 4-pyridine fragments could be useful except that the side groups extend into the solvent, making the 3-pyridine the preferred binding motif. x0995 presents an example fragment with an aniline-NH2 group in a beneficial location, a highly polar region where the N-terminal SER1 from chain B interacts with ASP142 and the backbone of PHE140. Also, x1093 offers an example of a larger ring system for increasing the surface contact area and the potential for additional polar and/or hydrogen bonding interactions to further increase the affinity of a piece of the drug molecule at this region of the binding pocket.

For example, the 4-pyridine fragments could be useful except that the side groups extend into the solvent, making the 3-pyridine the preferred binding motif. x0995 presents an example fragment with an aniline-NH2 group in a beneficial location, a highly polar region where the N-terminal SER1 from chain B interacts with ASP142 and the backbone of PHE140. Also, x1093 offers an example of a larger ring system for increasing the surface contact area and the potential for additional polar and/or hydrogen bonding interactions to further increase the affinity of a piece of the drug molecule at this region of the binding pocket.

Another interesting feature of this fragment screen is the similarity of binding pose between x0678 and x0434. The 3-pyridine side of the molecules are exactly the same and bind almost identically to the protein. The opposite side of the molecules differ, with each offering advantages or disadvantages for further exploration. Therefore, I am proposing a set of compounds based on the x0434 and x0678 fragments with varying extensions to the 3-pyridine motif. These compounds all maintain the hydrogen bond acceptor with the epsilon nitrogen of HIS163 and incorporate a nitrogen, either exocyclic as demonstrated with x0995 or incorporated into larger 6+5 or 6+6 bicyclic heteroaromatic rings, to interact with the N-terminus of chain B. These compounds offer varying protonation states and angles for interacting with this key region of the enzyme.","x0107,x0434,x0678,x0995,x1093",https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/SID-ELM-2583a2cd

This tripeptide matches the three amino acids at the angiotensin I C-terminus.

Pantoliano and coworkers speculated (in their 2004 publication on the crystallographic characterization of ACE2) that the conformational distortion induced in ACE2 by substrate binding (within the active site cleft) might be adequate to disfavor viral binding. They incidentally noted that ACE2 could operate on non-native substrates, and that catalytic efficiency processing angiotensin I was orders of magnitude less than that of angiotensin II, despite good binding. This may imply that simple peptides may function as quasi-inhibitors.

To be clear, the goal here would be to induce the ""protected conformation"" of ACE2. This peptide is not intended to target viral proteins. (Fragment x0072 was arbitrarily selected just to be able to submit the form.)

If true, then perhaps simple digestion of protein could supply meaning levels of suitable peptides. This would suggest that diet may be a contributing factor to people's vastly differing levels of susceptibility to COVID-19. Otherwise, other modes of delivery could be considered (IV, aerosol).

Furthermore, it will be noted that the aliphatic component of chloroquine is similar to remdesivir, nitazoxanide, and a number of other small molecules believed to have in vitro efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. This structure may actually fit well within what Pantoliano and coworkers called the ""Try510 lid"" of ACE2.

With this aim, we took from e-Drug3D (https://chemoinfo.ipmc.cnrs.fr/MOLDB/index.php) all the 1930 molecular structures approved between 1939 and 2019 by the FDA with a molecular weight ≤ 2000 Da and docked them at the binding site of 6LU7 structure by using three different docking programs (i.e., GlideSP, FRED and VINA). For each ligand and docking program, we have kept the top 10 docked poses (i.e., 10 for GlideSP, 10 for FRED and 10 for VINA). When considering 10 poses per ligand/program we assume that one of them will be the bioactive one (although the score function not always have ranked it as the first one). Finally the bioactive pose is assumed to be identified if it has been found simultaneously by the three programs (this means that the rmsd for each pairwise pose comparison is below 1.5 angstroms). Our idea here is that, in general, protein-ligand docking programs are really good when trying to look for the possible poses of a ligand in a binding site but usually fail to rank correctly such poses. Then, if three different protein-ligand programs find the same pose, this have a high probability to be the bioactive one.

Then, we applied a second filter in order to keep only those poses that are not only identified by the three programs but also show high affinity for M-pro. In order to find which threshold can be used to discriminate high from low affinity poses, we docked the 1577 compounds from the OTAVA Machine Learning SARS Targeted Library (https://otavachemicals.com/targets/sars-cov-2-targeted-libraries?utm_medium=email&utm_source=UniSender&utm_campaign=229613803) into the binding site of 6LU7 with GlideSP, FRED and VINA (with the identical set up conditions than were previously used for the 1930 FDA approved compounds). For this docking, we kept only the top-ranked pose obtained for each ligand by each programs. Then, we make three different histograms for the docking results of the OTAVA library (one per program) and arbitrarily selected as a threshold for distinguish from low to high M-pro affinity the lowest score value of the interval that contains the top 30% poses with the highest affinity. The resulting threshold was -6.3 for GlideSP, -7.0 for FRED and -7.5 for VINA. Then, all the poses that had succeed the first filter but had scores more positive than these threshold values were removed.

Then, only 5 FDA approved compounds simultaneously accomplished that: (1) the same pose is found independently by GlideSP, FRED and VINA; and (2) this pose has score values equal or more negative than the three mentioned thresholds.

Cc1nnc2n1-c1ccc(Cl)cc1C(c1ccccc1)=NC2,GER-UNI-cad0fe83-1,"GERARD PUJADAS, Universitat Rovira i Virgili","The main goal of our project was the repositioning of accepted drugs as M-pro inhibitors. With this aim, we took from e-Drug3D (https://chemoinfo.ipmc.cnrs.fr/MOLDB/index.php) all the 1930 molecular structures approved between 1939 and 2019 by the FDA with a molecular weight ≤ 2000 Da and docked them at the binding site of 6LU7 structure by using three different docking programs (i.e., GlideSP, FRED and VINA). For each ligand and docking program, we have kept the top 10 docked poses (i.e., 10 for GlideSP, 10 for FRED and 10 for VINA). When considering 10 poses per ligand/program we assume that one of them will be the bioactive one (although the score function not always have ranked it as the first one). Finally the bioactive pose is assumed to be identified if it has been found simultaneously by the three programs (this means that the rmsd for each pairwise pose comparison is below 1.5 angstroms). Our idea here is that, in general, protein-ligand docking programs are really good when trying to look for the possible poses of a ligand in a binding site but usually fail to rank correctly such poses. Then, if three different protein-ligand programs find the same pose, this have a high probability to be the bioactive one.

Then, we applied a second filter in order to keep only those poses that are not only identified by the three programs but also show high affinity for M-pro. In order to find which threshold can be used to discriminate high from low affinity poses, we docked the 1577 compounds from the OTAVA Machine Learning SARS Targeted Library (https://otavachemicals.com/targets/sars-cov-2-targeted-libraries?utm_medium=email&utm_source=UniSender&utm_campaign=229613803) into the binding site of 6LU7 with GlideSP, FRED and VINA (with the identical set up conditions than were previously used for the 1930 FDA approved compounds). For this docking, we kept only the top-ranked pose obtained for each ligand by each programs. Then, we make three different histograms for the docking results of the OTAVA library (one per program) and arbitrarily selected as a threshold for distinguish from low to high M-pro affinity the lowest score value of the interval that contains the top 30% poses with the highest affinity. The resulting threshold was -6.3 for GlideSP, -7.0 for FRED and -7.5 for VINA. Then, all the poses that had succeed the first filter but had scores more positive than these threshold values were removed.

Then, only 5 FDA approved compounds simultaneously accomplished that: (1) the same pose is found independently by GlideSP, FRED and VINA; and (2) this pose has score values equal or more negative than the three mentioned thresholds.

2) searched  PDB for related enzymes and PDBbind for potent ligands binding to these enzymes
3) shortlisted  4YoJ, inhibitor is with 0.4 uM one of the most potent inhibitors for related enzymes, synthesis appears to be pretty straight forward (Targeting zoonotic viruses: Structure-based inhibition of the 3C-like protease from bat coronavirus HKU4—The likely reservoir host to the human coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Sarah E.St. JohnabcSakshiTomaracShaun R.StaufferdeAndrew D.Mesecarabc )
4) The core (amid bond) of the ligand in 4YOJ also superimposes very well with  X_0434 and X_0678
5) P1 is occupied by benzotriazol in 4YOJ, should also fit in Mpro
6) pyridine (found in X_0107, X_0434, X_0678) should also fit in this pocket
7) X_0995 has a pyrimidine, but this can not easily be attached to the core
8) other heterocycles which have an acceptor group overlapping with the nitrogen atom in X_0107 could also be explored
9) P2-P4 pocket is occupied with a thiophenyl group in 4YOJ
10) this area is not well explored by the fragments. The fragments that bind there don't have a vector that could be joined with the core of the ligand in 4YOJ
10) based on synthetic route described in the paper mentioned above, Enamine building block library was searched for in stock compounds which have an aldehyde group directly attached to an aromatic ring => 429 this
11) Used RDkit to replace the part of the ligand in 4YOJ that goes into this subpocket and docked the resulting compounds into the X_0107 binding site using FlexX, used parts of ligand in 4YOJ as template, rescoring was done with Hyde
12) This pocket is very tight and only three reasonable hits very obtained (predicted affinity low micromolar, N-methyl-pyrol, Fluro-thiophen, Fluro-furan)
13) other five-membered rings could also be explored
14) P2-P1' pocket is rather hydrophobic, X_1334, X_1412, X_1385, X_1380, X_1336, X_0774, but the vectors in these fragments are not suited to link them with the core of the ligand in 4YOJ

4) The core (amid bond) of the ligand in 4YOJ also superimposes very well with  X_0434 and X_0678

6) pyridine (found in X_0107, X_0434, X_0678) should also fit in this pocket

9) P2-P4 pocket is occupied with a thiophenyl group in 4YOJ
10) this area is not well explored by the fragments. The fragments that bind there don't have a vector that could be joined with the core of the ligand in 4YOJ
10) based on synthetic route described in the paper mentioned above, Enamine building block library was searched for in stock compounds which have an aldehyde group directly attached to an aromatic ring => 429 this
11) Used RDkit to replace the part of the ligand in 4YOJ that goes into this subpocket and docked the resulting compounds into the X_0107 binding site using FlexX, used parts of ligand in 4YOJ as template, rescoring was done with Hyde
12) This pocket is very tight and only three reasonable hits very obtained (predicted affinity low micromolar, N-methyl-pyrol, Fluro-thiophen, Fluro-furan)
13) other five-membered rings could also be explored
14) P2-P1' pocket is rather hydrophobic, X_1334, X_1412, X_1385, X_1380, X_1336, X_0774, but the vectors in these fragments are not suited to link them with the core of the ligand in 4YOJ

Based on these results, I suggest to
1) synthesize and test the ligand that is contained in 4YOJ

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well. RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy units (REU). MoleculeComplexity is a metric by Ertl. et al., 2009, Journal of Cheminformatics, and generally less than 2.5 indicates the molecule is reasonably synthesizable.","x0104,x0107,x0946,x0995",https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/BEN-VAN-d8fd1356

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score.

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well. RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy units (REU).

 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well. RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy units (REU). MoleculeComplexity is a metric by Ertl. et al., 2009, Journal of Cheminformatics, and generally less than 2.5 indicates the molecule is reasonably synthesizable.","x0104,x0107,x0946,x0995",https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/BEN-VAN-d8fd1356

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well. RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy units (REU). MoleculeComplexity is a metric by Ertl. et al., 2009, Journal of Cheminformatics, and generally less than 2.5 indicates the molecule is reasonably synthesizable.","x0107,x1384",https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/BEN-VAN-5787f7d3

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well. RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy units (REU). MoleculeComplexity is a metric by Ertl. et al., 2009, Journal of Cheminformatics, and generally less than 2.5 indicates the molecule is reasonably synthesizable.","x0107,x1384",https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/BEN-VAN-5787f7d3

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well. RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy units (REU). MoleculeComplexity is a metric by Ertl. et al., 2009, Journal of Cheminformatics, and generally less than 2.5 indicates the molecule is reasonably synthesizable.","x0107,x1384",https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/BEN-VAN-5787f7d3

 Notes on the chemical profile:

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score.

 Notes on the chemical profile:

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well. RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy units (REU). MoleculeComplexity is a metric by Ertl. et al., 2009, Journal of Cheminformatics, and generally less than 2.5 indicates the molecule is reasonably synthesizable.","x0305,x0874,x0995",https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/BEN-VAN-d2b455e2

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL.

 Notes on the chemical profile:

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well. RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy units (REU). MoleculeComplexity is a metric by Ertl. et al., 2009, Journal of Cheminformatics, and generally less than 2.5 indicates the molecule is reasonably synthesizable.","x0305,x0874,x0995",https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/BEN-VAN-d2b455e2

To enable this, we used Cyclica’s Ligand Design™  (LD), a flexible machine learning for identifying molecules that best satisfy a defined objective function. Briefly, LD traverses a chemical space iteratively by repeatedly deriving new molecules (children) from previous selections (parents) and then filtering them with respect to one or more objective functions. This optimization process proceeds until convergence, when no better molecules can be found. Ligand Design has multiple options for traversing chemical space, including fixed library screening (10^6 molecules evaluated), rule-based semi-generative approaches (~10^10 molecules represented), and fully generative options (~10^120 molecule possibilities). Importantly, for this design challenge, we used the semi-generative option for LD (that was developed with support from our Partners at Enamine), which efficiently traverses the Enamine REAL Space of molecules to identify promising molecules with high synthetic accessibility. 

For this design challenge, we applied two major selective pressures (objective functions). The first optimizes for compatibility with the 3CLpro binding site using Cyclica’s MatchMaker Deep Learning proteome-screening engine (white paper here: https://tinyurl.com/wx3yg64). MatchMaker has been found to be far more accurate than molecular docking, and is also several orders of magnitude more computationally efficient. The second is a ligand-based model consisting of all active fragments coming from the XChem screen. This model was created using our POEM technology (https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04555), a parameter-free supervised learning algorithm that utilizes multiple fingerprints simultaneously for improved predictive performance. Incorporation of this POEM model pressures LD to evolve molecules which resemble the fragment set (and prioritizes the molecules with higher occupancy in the crystal structures). Additional filters ensure that all molecules evaluated have ‘drug-like’ physicochemical properties and exclude problematic functional groups.  

Cyclica’s Ligand Design was applied using default parameters, allowing the optimization to proceed until convergence. The resulting process automatically defined a total of 106 ‘top molecules’ on the basis of proteome screening ranks. Among these top molecules, 35 ranked the corona virus protease compatibility higher than any human protein (~8000 present in the screen). A semi-manual curation process was applied to the 106 to prioritize molecules for submission. The first three were selected on the basis of having substructures with exact matches to hits from the XChem fragment screen. Next, we clustered the remaining top molecules using a multiple fingerprint approach and selected the 10 cluster exemplars for a total of 13 submissions. Any positive hits among cluster exemplars would merit subsequent investigation of the remaining cluster members.  

Note, For this submission Cyclica’s Ligand Design was used in its default state with no algorithmic customization or further optimizations to strictly enforce the presence of select fragments. We are open to further customizing this LD design process in subsequent design iterations, in order to incorporate the the expert insights of medicinal chemists involved in this project.","x0072,x0161,x0995",https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/VIJ-CYC-1a381570

To enable this, we used Cyclica’s Ligand Design™  (LD), a flexible machine learning for identifying molecules that best satisfy a defined objective function. Briefly, LD traverses a chemical space iteratively by repeatedly deriving new molecules (children) from previous selections (parents) and then filtering them with respect to one or more objective functions. This optimization process proceeds until convergence, when no better molecules can be found. Ligand Design has multiple options for traversing chemical space, including fixed library screening (10^6 molecules evaluated), rule-based semi-generative approaches (~10^10 molecules represented), and fully generative options (~10^120 molecule possibilities). Importantly, for this design challenge, we used the semi-generative option for LD (that was developed with support from our Partners at Enamine), which efficiently traverses the Enamine REAL Space of molecules to identify promising molecules with high synthetic accessibility. 

For this design challenge, we applied two major selective pressures (objective functions). The first optimizes for compatibility with the 3CLpro binding site using Cyclica’s MatchMaker Deep Learning proteome-screening engine (white paper here: https://tinyurl.com/wx3yg64). MatchMaker has been found to be far more accurate than molecular docking, and is also several orders of magnitude more computationally efficient. The second is a ligand-based model consisting of all active fragments coming from the XChem screen. This model was created using our POEM technology (https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04555), a parameter-free supervised learning algorithm that utilizes multiple fingerprints simultaneously for improved predictive performance. Incorporation of this POEM model pressures LD to evolve molecules which resemble the fragment set (and prioritizes the molecules with higher occupancy in the crystal structures). Additional filters ensure that all molecules evaluated have ‘drug-like’ physicochemical properties and exclude problematic functional groups.  

Cyclica’s Ligand Design was applied using default parameters, allowing the optimization to proceed until convergence. The resulting process automatically defined a total of 106 ‘top molecules’ on the basis of proteome screening ranks. Among these top molecules, 35 ranked the corona virus protease compatibility higher than any human protein (~8000 present in the screen). A semi-manual curation process was applied to the 106 to prioritize molecules for submission. The first three were selected on the basis of having substructures with exact matches to hits from the XChem fragment screen. Next, we clustered the remaining top molecules using a multiple fingerprint approach and selected the 10 cluster exemplars for a total of 13 submissions. Any positive hits among cluster exemplars would merit subsequent investigation of the remaining cluster members.

 Notes on the chemical profile:

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well. RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy units (REU). MoleculeComplexity is a metric by Ertl. et al., 2009, Journal of Cheminformatics, and generally less than 2.5 indicates the molecule is reasonably synthesizable.","x0759,x1478",https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/BEN-VAN-77cef4f8

This generative model was sampled, and produced ~20,000 novel structures. The QED score for each generated molecule was computed, and the top 1,000 generated molecules according to QED score were kept. Any generated molecules that were identical to the submissions were discarded during generation. Also, the Tanimoto similarity of each generated molecule was computed against each submission and fragment molecule, and any generated molecule with a Tanimoto similarity >= 0.9 was discarded during generation. The generated compounds generally had low average Tanimoto similarity to the submission and fragment compounds. This set of 1,000 generated molecules was combined with a set of 1,018 molecules generated on a previous date (using a different language model).

Each of the 2,018 generated molecules were then submitted to docking with the SARS-CoV-2 apo-MPro protein structure from the 6YB7_model.pdb file (provided by Diamond Light Source), using AutoDock Vina, with an exhaustiveness value of 16. Docking was focused on the active site. The molecules with a best mode binding energy of -7.9 kcal/mol or less were kept, resulting in 30 candidates. These 30 molecules were then docked once again, but using an exhaustiveness value of 256. Docking was repeated 3 times for each of the candidates. Also, the Synthetic Accessibility (SA) score was calculated for each candidate, as well as a toxicity estimate using the ProTox-II web service. A final weighted score was computed for each candidate using the normalized mean Vina best mode binding energy (50%), the QED score (20%), the normalized SA score (20%), and the normalized estimated LD50 (10%).

Here the acrylamide moiety (see entry STE-LAU-835) was replaced by NH(CO)CH2Phe-OH. The compound therefore lacks the Cys-modifying group. The compound was docked using the structure generated with the x0072 fragment (pdb 5R7Y). Docking and partial minimization was performed with Nanome (virtual reality). Two clefts are occupied by the diethylamine and the ethylenediamine moieties.  There are multiple H bonds to Asn142. The phenolic OH group interacts with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Thr26. There is also an additional H bond between the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Glu166 and one of the ethylenediamine nitrogens (protonated form).,x0072,https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/STE-LAU-de673641

However, when I was looking to the pockets available in this S protein, which seem very prone to allow binding of small molecules, I immediately thought of this sdp compound. It is a molecule very predisposed to establish hydrogen bonds and pi-pi interactions. Unfortunately, at the present, I'm no expert in computational studies, but many of you are, so please if you can, include this molecule in your calculations. Furthermore, the synthetic pathway is rather simple, only two steps to the final compound (see the article), and it is water soluble, and all the pK's in strictly aqueous solution were determined. The log K values are: 8.81, 3.76, 2.80, 2.24, meaning that the most dominant species is HL+ between pH ~ 4 and ~ 9.",x0072,https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/CAT-CEN-91a3f3b0

In addition to proposing a fluoro- substituent at the ortho position to the attachment point of the 7-azaindole ring, I am also proposing a chloro- substituent at the same location. I am also proposing some nitrogen replacements in the 7-azaindole ring to modulate electronic interactions with the binding pocket, slightly adjust angles for h-bonding interactions, and/or provide additional polar interactions with nearby polar side chains, e.g. ASN142. 

Finally, I am also proposing changing the linker to a carbamate analogous to x0434. The attached PDB file contains QM/MM energy minimized structures for all 18 of these candidates along with the dimer of the Mpro enzyme to see how these ligands interact with the SER1 N-terminal ammonium group.","x0434,x1093",https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/SID-ELM-1f105489

With this aim, we took from the Reaxys-marketed library 4536 drugs labeled as “marketed” in the field “Highest clinical phase” of the Reaxys database and docked them at the binding site of 6LU7 structure by using three different docking programs (i.e., GlideSP, FRED and VINA). For each ligand and docking program, we have kept the top 10 docked poses (i.e., 10 for GlideSP, 10 for FRED and 10 for VINA). When considering 10 poses per ligand/program we assume that one of them will be the bioactive one (although the score function not always have ranked it as the first one). Finally the bioactive pose is assumed to be identified if it has been found simultaneously by the three programs (this means that the rmsd for each pairwise pose comparison is below 1.5 angstroms). Our idea here is that, in general, protein-ligand docking programs are really good when trying to look for the possible poses of a ligand in a binding site but usually fail to rank correctly such poses. Then, if three different protein-ligand programs find the same pose, this have a high probability to be the bioactive one.

Then, we applied a second filter in order to keep only those poses that are not only identified by the three programs but also show high affinity for M-pro. In order to find which threshold can be used to discriminate high from low affinity poses, we docked the 1577 compounds from the OTAVA Machine Learning SARS Targeted Library (https://otavachemicals.com/targets/sars-cov-2-targeted-libraries?utm_medium=email&utm_source=UniSender&utm_campaign=229613803) into the binding site of 6LU7 with GlideSP, FRED and VINA (with the identical set up conditions than were previously used for the 1930 FDA approved compounds). For this docking, we kept only the top-ranked pose obtained for each ligand by each programs. Then, we make three different histograms for the docking results of the OTAVA library (one per program) and arbitrarily selected as a threshold for distinguish from low to high M-pro affinity the lowest score value of the interval that contains the top 30% poses with the highest affinity. The resulting threshold was -6.3 for GlideSP, -7.0 for FRED and -7.5 for VINA. Then, all the poses that had succeed the first filter but had scores more positive than these threshold values were removed.

Then, only 2 marketed compounds simultaneously accomplished that: (1) the same pose is found independently by GlideSP, FRED and VINA; and (2) this pose has score values equal or more negative than the three mentioned thresholds.

We converted it to a peptidomimetic molecule with a Michael acceptor for covalent bonding to Cys145 and docked it onto 6y2e PDB using rosetta ligand docking. The approximate ligand docking protocol is as follows, 
1. First we used SiteHound to identify posssible ligand binding sites in 6y2e using a Methyl probe. Three binding sites were found but only the active site showed the highest score qualifying for the subsequent docking run. 
2. The ligand was placed close to 6y2e at the XYZ coordinates obtained for high scoring solution from SiteHound. 10,000 docking poses were generated by restricting the ligand to a box of 10 Å radius and perturbing (rotation + translation) the ligand 5 Å. Rosetta calculated the interface_delta score which is approximate measure of the interaction between the ligand and the protein. Top 10 solution sorted using interface_delta score were manually inspected in pymol. All 10 solutions docked the ligand in the active site.
Key Features of the docked pose are:
- The peptidomimetic molecule contains two phenylalanines and one arginine. 
- The Michael acceptor is placed close to C145 for covalent bond formation
- The N-term Phe occupies hydrophobic pocket formed by residues H41, M49, F140, H163
- The C-term Phe occupies hydrophobic pocket formed by residues M165, L167, F185 and V186
- Arg forms a salt-bridge to E166 and another polar contact to the backbone carbonyls of residues L167 and P168. 

The ligand buries a total surface area of ~ 500 Å^2.

As starting point in this submission, fragment Mpro-x0967 was chosen based on its size, it being found as match in our focused library (molecules binding to similar proteins to the virus protease) and its good estimated affinity using BioSolveIT's SeeSAR software. SeeSAR was then used to grow (Recore) the fragment choosing a bond towards the bromide tail.

To guarantee synthetic accessibility, similar compounds within Enamine REAL space were searched using FTrees, based on the most promising compounds (estimated affinity and visual inspection). The so found compounds (no duplicates in current postera submissions, 31.03.2020) were clustered to find a diverse subset and the remaining compounds were redocked using SeeSAR.

To guarantee synthetic accessibility, similar compounds within Enamine REAL space were searched using FTrees, based on the most promising compounds (estimated affinity and visual inspection).

The generated children SMILES each have two parents. These SMILES were then used to generated a 3d conformer (with `smi23d`) which was refined with the MM94FF in `obminimize`. The resulting candidate molecule was then docked with Autodock Vina, against 6YB7 selecting near the catalytic site . From these 100'000 data points, the 20 highest scoring docked compounds were selected for submission. 

No additional human or algorithmic filtering has been done. (Note the double sulphone warhead in one of the molecules!)

I chose this method due to bitter experience in molecular design with both computational and machine learning approaches. Due to the exponentially large chemical configuration space, any attempt to optimise a metric with errors (such as docking) will lead to the selection of the much more numerous false-positives than a genuine hit. By constraining the design algorithm to mixing two known-valid molecules (the fragments from Diamond), you strongly bias the exploration of chemical space to plausible regions, while giving sufficient freedom for the algorithm to select arbitrary combinations that would not be considered by a human.  

As the structures are two fused fragments, they are approaching the size of a drug-like molecule.

Rather than targeting the Sars Cov2 protease in the native state, we are attempting to stabilize folding intermediates by designing compounds that are predicted to bind non-native cavities within these intermediates, thus stabilizing them. Our approach is akin to allosteric drug design, except that we aim to stabilize less structured states which may be prone to proteolytic degradation and/or aggregation in the cell. We expect it may be harder for the virus to evolve resistance to such compounds, as nonnative cavities often involve residues that are buried in the native state--thus, mutation of these residues may be detrimental to native stability. We model folding intermediates of a single subunit of the protease's N-terminal domain, on the assumptions that the domains fold independently, and dimerization precedes subunit folding. To predict these intermediates, we apply the algorithm in (1) (see Notes), which can rapidly simulate folding of complex proteins at the atomistic level while accounting for non-native states. We then grow compounds that are predicted to bind  these intermediates at specific cavities using the OpenGrowth algorithm detailed in (2), keeping only compounds that predicted to bind with sub-micromolar affinity whose synthetic accessibility is less than 4.0, and which are predicted to bind a large number of representative snapshots assigned to a given folding intermediate with a similar binding profile, as computed using the AlphaSpace method (3). Three such compounds, each bound to a predicted folding intermediate, are included as separate submissions.",x0072,https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/AMI-SHA-0ab64bbd

This module consists of two functional parts. The first provides pharmacophore-based mapping of targeted cavity by molecular fragments (probes) with their further minimization. The second subprogram provides step-by-step linking of building blocks to the probes, taking into account the protein environment. Since ligands of crystal structures acted as initial probes in current experiment, only the second part of QSB module was used.
As starting molecules, ligands from 5REY, 5REN, 5RFG crystals were used. Model was built based on protein structure from 6LU7 crystal. Libraries of building blocks were obtained by fragmentation of molecules from Enamine 10K diverse collection with BRICS algorithm.
Five stages of structure building have been completed. In the first two stages, libraries of larger fragments (linkers) were used in order to extend the scaffold structure.

This module consists of two functional parts. The first provides pharmacophore-based mapping of targeted cavity by molecular fragments (probes) with their further minimization. The second subprogram provides step-by-step linking of building blocks to the probes, taking into account the protein environment. Since ligands of crystal structures acted as initial probes in current experiment, only the second part of QSB module was used.
As starting molecules, ligands from 5REY, 5REN, 5RFG crystals were used. Model was built based on protein structure from 6LU7 crystal. Libraries of building blocks were obtained by fragmentation of molecules from Enamine 10K diverse collection with BRICS algorithm.
Five stages of structure building have been completed. In the first two stages, libraries of larger fragments (linkers) were used in order to extend the scaffold structure. At each of these two consecutive steps, the top 20 structures were selected by the module based on calculated energy values and then the top 5 of them were selected for further calculations based on expert evaluation.

The best compounds were selected based on overall docking scores and predicted bioavailability.[8]

The top 20 compounds were selected based on their docking scores. The top 12 are predicted to be absorbed gastrointestinally and cross the blood-brain barrier and the next 8 are only predicted to be absorbed gastrointestinally. Given difficulties in obtaining solvents right now, we will weigh requisite amounts into glass vials and ship them to Anthony Aimon at Diamond.

# Notes on the chemical profile:
#
# Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released to the PDB by von Grelft group) served as starting
# scaffolds for redesign with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign. The variation of this algorithm
# utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand
# interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step
# to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. The best optimizations by QSAR/QSPR analysis
# are recombined with BCL::LinkFragments, an in-development combinatorial chemistry algorithm. Again, molecules are optimized for clash resolution and
# interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to
# intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex
# is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring
# pose. We subsequently performed 3 independent molecular dynamics simulations for the best molecules. Each simulation was 1000 ns in length.

This module consists of two functional parts. The first provides pharmacophore-based mapping of targeted cavity by molecular fragments (probes) with their further minimization. The second subprogram provides step-by-step linking of building blocks to the probes, taking into account the protein environment. Since ligands of crystal structures acted as initial probes in current experiment, only the second part of QSB module was used.
As starting molecule, ligand from 5REL crystal was used. Model was built based on protein structure from 6LU7 crystal. Libraries of building blocks were obtained by fragmentation of molecules from Enamine 10K diverse collection with BRICS algorithm.
Five stages of structure building have been completed. In the first two stages, libraries of larger fragments (linkers) were used in order to extend the scaffold structure. At each of these two consecutive steps, the top 20 structures were selected by the module based on calculated energy values and then the top 5 of them were selected for further calculations based on expert evaluation. The next 3 stages were aimed at linking small functional groups and were performed automatically. During the first two stages the 5 best structures were automatically selected for the next step. At the final step, the 20 best structures in terms of energy were retained.",x0692,https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/BOG-INS-bdba9cfb

The N-phenylbenzamide scaffold of Niclosamide may bind in similar way as the benzamide (X_0678) and (di)phenylurea (X_0434) scaffolds observed in several fragments.

Obviously early days and appreciating that recognising simple substructures between hits and assuming they bind in a similar manner can be deceiving. I have therefore also included 9 designs to efficiently explore simple SAR around the putative niclosamide hit, which can be helpful to provide more confidence in the binding mode hypothesis and customise/extend the scope of the associated designs.

The second subprogram provides step-by-step linking of building blocks to the probes, taking into account the protein environment. Since ligands of crystal structures acted as initial probes in current experiment, only the second part of QSB module was used.
As starting molecules, ligands from 5REY, 5REN, 5RFG crystals were used. Model was built based on protein structure from 6LU7 crystal. Libraries of building blocks were obtained by fragmentation of molecules from Enamine 10K diverse collection with BRICS algorithm.
Five stages of structure building have been completed. In the first two stages, libraries of larger fragments (linkers) were used in order to extend the scaffold structure. At each of these two consecutive steps, the top 20 structures were selected by the module based on calculated energy values and then the top 5 of them were selected for further calculations based on expert evaluation. The next 3 stages were aimed at linking small functional groups and were performed automatically. During the first two stages the 5 best structures were automatically selected for the next step.

Rather than targeting the Sars Cov2 protease in the native state, we are attempting to stabilize folding intermediates by designing compounds that are predicted to bind non-native cavities within these intermediates, thus stabilizing them. Our approach is akin to allosteric drug design, except that we aim to stabilize less structured states which may be prone to proteolytic degradation and/or aggregation in the cell. We expect it may be harder for the virus to evolve resistance to such compounds, as nonnative cavities often involve residues that are buried in the native state--thus, mutation of these residues may be detrimental to native stability. We model folding intermediates of a single subunit of the protease's N-terminal domain, on the assumptions that the domains fold independently, and dimerization precedes subunit folding. To predict these intermediates, we apply the algorithm in (1) (see Notes), which can rapidly simulate folding of complex proteins at the atomistic level while accounting for non-native states. We then grow compounds that are predicted to bind  these intermediates at specific cavities using the OpenGrowth algorithm detailed in (2), keeping only compounds that predicted to bind with sub-micromolar affinity whose synthetic accessibility is less than 4.0, and which are predicted to bind a large number of representative snapshots assigned to a given folding intermediate with a similar binding profile, as computed using the AlphaSpace method (3).

CC(C(=O)O)c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c1ccc(Cl)cc12,GER-UNI-ec786817-1,"GERARD PUJADAS, Universitat Rovira i Virgili","The main goal of our project was the repositioning of accepted drugs as M-pro inhibitors. With this aim, we took from e-Drug3D (https://chemoinfo.ipmc.cnrs.fr/MOLDB/index.php) all the 1930 molecular structures approved between 1939 and 2019 by the FDA with a molecular weight ≤ 2000 Da and docked them at the binding site of 6LU7 structure by using three different docking programs (i.e., GlideSP, FRED and VINA). For each ligand and docking program, we have kept the top 10 docked poses (i.e., 10 for GlideSP, 10 for FRED and 10 for VINA). When considering 10 poses per ligand/program we assume that one of them will be the bioactive one (although the score function not always have ranked it as the first one). Finally the bioactive pose is assumed to be identified if it has been found simultaneously by the three programs (this means that the rmsd for each pairwise pose comparison is below 1.5 angstroms). Our idea here is that, in general, protein-ligand docking programs are really good when trying to look for the possible poses of a ligand in a binding site but usually fail to rank correctly such poses. Then, if three different protein-ligand programs find the same pose, this have a high probability to be the bioactive one.

Then, we applied a second filter in order to keep only those poses that are not only identified by the three programs but also show high affinity for M-pro. In order to find which threshold can be used to discriminate high from low affinity poses, we docked the 1577 compounds from the OTAVA Machine Learning SARS Targeted Library (https://otavachemicals.com/targets/sars-cov-2-targeted-libraries?utm_medium=email&utm_source=UniSender&utm_campaign=229613803) into the binding site of 6LU7 with GlideSP, FRED and VINA (with the identical set up conditions than were previously used for the 1930 FDA approved compounds). For this docking, we kept only the top-ranked pose obtained for each ligand by each programs. Then, we make three different histograms for the docking results of the OTAVA library (one per program) and arbitrarily selected as a threshold for distinguish from low to high M-pro affinity the lowest score value of the interval that contains the top 30% poses with the highest affinity. The resulting threshold was -6.3 for GlideSP, -7.0 for FRED and -7.5 for VINA. Then, all the poses that had succeed the first filter but had scores more positive than these threshold values were removed.

Then, only 5 FDA approved compounds simultaneously accomplished that: (1) the same pose is found independently by GlideSP, FRED and VINA; and (2) this pose has score values equal or more negative than the three mentioned thresholds.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION: A Nitrile group, placed at ortho-position to the sulfonamide moiety of fragment x0161, is able to fit a sub pocket located where water molecule W116 (Structure x0336) is located. This substitution can impact favourably ligand binding both from an enthalpic and entropic contributions (i.e. Biophys J. 2015 Feb 17; 108(4): 928–936). 

Alternatively the Nitrile group can be replaced by a cyclic N-acyl sulfoximine core. It is able to fit a sub pocket located where W116 (Structure x0336) is located. The carbonyl oxygen at the cyclic N-acyl sulfoximine core is able to interact (H bond) with the Gln192 side chain and Thr190 backbone. This group is located in an overlapping region to the occupied volume by the sulfoxide oxigen of DMS901 (structure x0354). The S-attached methyl group of the chiral core (R enantiomer) is interacting with Pro168, while the S-attached oxygen atom is (favourably) directed towards a more solvent exposed area of the binding pocket. 

At the para-position (to the S-attached sulfoximine substituent) of the aromatic ring, the binding pocket is more shallow and able to accommodate several different structural motifs. Bulky, sp3 rich motifs should be well tolerated in this region and could enable the ideation of structurally diverse lead molecules with good solubility and PK properties. 

A set 7 and 8 membered rings structures derived from the Crystallography Open Database (stripped of major substituents) were rigidly docked to assess the potential fit to this accessory binding pocket. This approach was used in order to avoid incurring MM minimization artifacts and to quickly get a flavour of interesting substituents worth exploring. The 1,4-oxazepine derivative is inspired from the Crystallography Open Database (ref. 1100289) after QM optimization. The N-attached methyl group is fitting into the hydrophobic pocket delimited by Met165 and Phe181 side chains. Similarly, a polar lipophilic pocket compatible unit, such as a nitrile (R-CN, where R is an aromatic group) has also been seen to explore such a region (fragment  x0305). The methyl group attached to the carbon at the 3 position of the oxazepinone is interacting with the Met165 side chain. The oxygen (position 1 of the oxazepinone) is almost coplanar to the aromatic ring, towards the solvent exposed area of the binding pocket.  The carbonyl oxygen is placed in a mild polar binding pocket, interacting with a conserved water molecule (W6). Some of the reported oxazepinones might be challenging to synthesize or introduce unwanted complexity in the designed compound (i.e. 3 chiral centers).
 
Alternatively, a sulfonamide to a non cyclic acyl sulfoximine transformation was applied. The S-attached methyl group of the chiral group (S enantiomer) is interacting with Pro168, while the S-attached oxygen atom is directed towards a more solvent exposed area. The carbonyl oxygen of the acyl group is interacting with W39 and the amide NH is hydrogen bonded with Glu166 backbone. Pyridine nitrogen is interacting with water molecules W116. 
We also suggest synthesizing the R enantiomer. Preliminary docking studies suggest that the protein interaction pattern might be different.","x0161,x0305",https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/DAV-AUT-7eb4e0c3

The three new ligands we are submitting have better binding affinities than darunavir, tipranavir, colchicine, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, remdesivir, and favipiravir on the Mpro.

This module consists of two functional parts. The first provides pharmacophore-based mapping of targeted cavity by molecular fragments (probes) with their further minimization. The second subprogram provides step-by-step linking of building blocks to the probes, taking into account the protein environment. Since ligands of crystal structures acted as initial probes in current experiment, only the second part of QSB module was used.
As starting molecules, ligands from 5REY, 5REN, 5RFG crystals were used. Model was built based on protein structure from 6LU7 crystal. Libraries of building blocks were obtained by fragmentation of molecules from Enamine 10K diverse collection with BRICS algorithm.
Five stages of structure building have been completed. In the first two stages, libraries of larger fragments (linkers) were used in order to extend the scaffold structure. At each of these two consecutive steps, the top 20 structures were selected by the module based on calculated energy values and then the top 5 of them were selected for further calculations based on expert evaluation. The next 3 stages were aimed at linking small functional groups and were performed automatically. During the first two stages the 5 best structures were automatically selected for the next step. At the final step, the 20 best structures in terms of energy were retained.",x1311,https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/INS-INS-398f5681

We converted it to a peptidomimetic molecule with a Michael acceptor for covalent bonding to Cys145 and docked it onto 6y2e PDB using rosetta ligand docking. The approximate ligand docking protocol is as follows, 
1. First we used SiteHound to identify posssible ligand binding sites in 6y2e using a Methyl probe. Three binding sites were found but only the active site showed the highest score qualifying for the subsequent docking run. 
2. The ligand was placed close to 6y2e at the XYZ coordinates obtained for high scoring solution from SiteHound. 10,000 docking poses were generated by restricting the ligand to a box of 10 Å radius and perturbing (rotation + translation) the ligand 5 Å. Rosetta calculated the interface_delta score which is approximate measure of the interaction between the ligand and the protein. Top 10 solution sorted using interface_delta score were manually inspected in pymol. All 10 solutions docked the ligand in the active site.
Key Features of the docked pose are:
- The peptidomimetic molecule contains two phenylalanines and one arginine. 
- The Michael acceptor is placed close to C145 for covalent bond formation

Reverie’s in-house fragment expansion engine was used to combinatorially place these fragments on the acetamide methyl position of fragment X0107 via a variety of simple, synthetically-accessible linkers. Results were filtered extensively for toxicity and reactivity using an in-house library of SMARTS patterns, and an RDKit cLogP cutoff of 5.0 was applied. The remaining 8.4K compounds were docked via multiple docking methods and pose-constrained to match the orientation of the crystal-bound X0107 fragment. An ensemble of scoring functions was used to select a set of 886 compounds with high predicted affinity.

These compounds were manually triaged by individuals on the Reverie chemistry team to select the final set of compounds for submission. The final set includes compounds that make favorable hydrophobic interactions with His41, Met49, and Thr25, as well as some that make buried hydrogen bonds with the Thr25 sidechain and the Cys44 backbone carbonyl.",x0107,https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/GAB-REV-70cc3ca5

My first step would be to replace the ketone warhead with a more drug-like warhead.

Rather than targeting the Sars Cov2 protease in the native state, we are attempting to stabilize folding intermediates by designing compounds that are predicted to bind non-native cavities within these intermediates, thus stabilizing them. Our approach is akin to allosteric drug design, except that we aim to stabilize less structured states which may be prone to proteolytic degradation and/or aggregation in the cell. We expect it may be harder for the virus to evolve resistance to such compounds, as nonnative cavities often involve residues that are buried in the native state--thus, mutation of these residues may be detrimental to native stability. We model folding intermediates of a single subunit of the protease's N-terminal domain, on the assumptions that the domains fold independently, and dimerization precedes subunit folding. To predict these intermediates, we apply the algorithm in (1) (see Notes), which can rapidly simulate folding of complex proteins at the atomistic level while accounting for non-native states. We then grow compounds that are predicted to bind  these intermediates at specific cavities using the OpenGrowth algorithm detailed in (2), keeping only compounds that predicted to bind with sub-micromolar affinity whose synthetic accessibility is less than 4.0, and which are predicted to bind a large number of representative snapshots assigned to a given folding intermediate with a similar binding profile, as computed using the AlphaSpace method (3). Three such compounds, each bound to a predicted folding intermediate, are included as separate submissions.",x0072,https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/AMI-SHA-be6e1b75

Reportedly, lopinavir has only mid-micromolar activity against SARS protease, ritonavir above 50 microM. (doi: 10.12688/f1000research.22457.1; doi: 10.1073/pnas.0403596101)

However, there is no crystal structure of the 2019-nCoV main protease with either of these two drugs that could clarify their potential for optimization against this target. Thus, I suggest lopinavir, ritonavir, and reasonably similar substructures available from catalog for soaking.

Procedure in KNIME:

1) search all substructures of lopinavir and ritonavir in MolPort
2) remove all redundant compounds and compounds with similarity < 0.5 (datawarrior SkelPheres) to either of the queries
3) remove all compounds void of a ring or containing amides (as substructures of amides)

This module consists of two functional parts. The first provides pharmacophore-based mapping of targeted cavity by molecular fragments (probes) with their further minimization. The second subprogram provides step-by-step linking of building blocks to the probes, taking into account the protein environment. Since ligands of crystal structures acted as initial probes in current experiment, only the second part of QSB module was used.
As starting molecules, ligands from 5REY, 5REN, 5RFG crystals were used. Model was built based on protein structure from 6LU7 crystal. Libraries of building blocks were obtained by fragmentation of molecules from Enamine 10K diverse collection with BRICS algorithm.
Five stages of structure building have been completed. In the first two stages, libraries of larger fragments (linkers) were used in order to extend the scaffold structure. At each of these two consecutive steps, the top 20 structures were selected by the module based on calculated energy values and then the top 5 of them were selected for further calculations based on expert evaluation. The next 3 stages were aimed at linking small functional groups and were performed automatically. During the first two stages the 5 best structures were automatically selected for the next step. At the final step, the 20 best structures in terms of energy were retained.",x1392,https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/INS-INS-68e9753a

CC(=O)N(C)CCCN1c2ccccc2CCc2ccccc21,KEN-UNI-c79d77dd-1,"Ken Lewtas, University of Edinburgh, LST Ltd., DLS","The rationale behind the structure came from looking at target site and also the HIT molecules. It occurred to me that the sizes of the HIT molecules and the placement of the functional groups were similar to commercial CNS antidepressants. My question was ""could such drugs work as antiviral agents?"" If so, use could be very quick. 

Taking Imipramine and converting the end group to an amide produced a molecule that, under superposition with HITs, produced a close match with their functional groups. The trans-gauche side-chain structure is the most stable conformer in solution. Hence I thought it was worth submitting at this early stage of participation.

Further modification could be removing one of the aromatic rings. I have submitted a .pdb file but not as a ""bound"" structure. I do not have this capability at the moment but will do soon.

The compound was highly stable and makes several consistent interactions with the binding site residues throughout the simulation, such as:
1. The pyridine N makes a very strong hydrogen bond with nearby His163 sidechain.
2. The same pyridine creates an aromatic interaction environment with nearby aromatic residues, His163 and His172.
3. The terminal amino group on pyridine ring, on the virtue of being protonated at physiological pH, makes a salt-bridge interaction with negatively-charged Glu166.
4. The same terminal amino group on pyridine ring, also makes a hydrogen bond with side-chain amide group of Asn142. 
5. One of the carbonyl oxygens on the middle dipyrimidone-like ring makes the pivotal hydrogen bond interaction with backbone of His164. 
6. The other carbonyl oxygen on the dipyrimidone-like ring could make a very likely interaction with backbone of Gly149, as this is present on a very long and flexible loop. The primary reason of making the dipyrimidone was to constrain the orientation of the molecule and connect different pieces of molecule.
7. The fused phenyl group of dipyrimidone-like entity provides critical aromatic interaction with aromatic residue His41.
8. The imidazole also makes a highly favorable aromatic interaction with side-chain of His41, along with a hydrogen bond between imidazole NH and N of His41.
9. The N-sulphonamide =O makes a hydrogen bond with backbone of Thr26, along with several hydrogen bonds with a network of waters.

We converted it to a peptidomimetic molecule with a Michael acceptor for covalent bonding to Cys145 and docked it onto 6y2e PDB using rosetta ligand docking. The approximate ligand docking protocol is as follows, 
1. First we used SiteHound to identify posssible ligand binding sites in 6y2e using a Methyl probe. Three binding sites were found but only the active site showed the highest score qualifying for the subsequent docking run. 
2. The ligand was placed close to 6y2e at the XYZ coordinates obtained for high scoring solution from SiteHound. 10,000 docking poses were generated by restricting the ligand to a box of 10 Å radius and perturbing (rotation + translation) the ligand 5 Å. Rosetta calculated the interface_delta score which is approximate measure of the interaction between the ligand and the protein. Top 10 solution sorted using interface_delta score were manually inspected in pymol. All 10 solutions docked the ligand in the active site.
Key Features of the docked pose are:
- The peptidomimetic molecule contains two phenylalanines and one arginine. 
- The Michael acceptor is placed close to C145 for covalent bond formation
- The N-term Phe occupies hydrophobic pocket formed by residues H41, M49, F140, H163
- The C-term Phe occupies hydrophobic pocket formed by residues M165, L167, F185 and V186
- Arg forms a salt-bridge to E166 and another polar contact to the backbone carbonyls of residues L167 and P168. 

The ligand buries a total surface area of ~ 500 Å^2.

This module consists of two functional parts. The first provides pharmacophore-based mapping of targeted cavity by molecular fragments (probes) with their further minimization. The second subprogram provides step-by-step linking of building blocks to the probes, taking into account the protein environment. Since ligands of crystal structures acted as initial probes in current experiment, only the second part of QSB module was used.
As starting molecule, ligand from 5RER crystal was used. Model was built based on protein structure from 6LU7 crystal. Libraries of building blocks were obtained by fragmentation of molecules from Enamine 10K diverse collection with BRICS algorithm.
Five stages of structure building have been completed. In the first two stages, libraries of larger fragments (linkers) were used in order to extend the scaffold structure. At each of these two consecutive steps, the top 20 structures were selected by the module based on calculated energy values and then the top 5 of them were selected for further calculations based on expert evaluation. The next 3 stages were aimed at linking small functional groups and were performed automatically. During the first two stages the 5 best structures were automatically selected for the next step. At the final step, the 20 best structures in terms of energy were retained.",x0759,https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/BOG-INS-8ebd826b

This made me immediately think of benzenesulfonamide drugs as there are a few of those. Among them, Hydrochlorothiazide seems to both nicely fulfil the benzensulfonamide pharmacophore as the N of the secondary sulfonamide also so-localizes with the tertiary amine of a few other fragments (e.g. x0354).

So, on the one side, you could potentially cocrystalize Hydrochlorothiazide alone and explore it for repurposing. On the other hand, as the compound is commercial, you could use it as a scaffold. I have used it as a scaffold in the molecule I sketched and explored whether I could add a pyridine with a linker to reach the pyridine hotspot. I think the linker I used would be the ideal length but you could explore several other linkers as well. I believe it should be possible to derivatize the sulfonamide but it's true that this could be challenging given there is another sulfonamide in the structure that could cross-react. I hope this helps, thank you so much for this initiative!","x0161,x0195,x0426,x0434,x0678,x0946,x0995",https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/ALB-THE-e2bfce8e

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well. RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy units (REU). MoleculeComplexity is a metric by Ertl. et al., 2009, Journal of Cheminformatics, and generally less than 2.5 indicates the molecule is reasonably synthesizable.","x0692,x0770,x0995",https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/BEN-VAN-c986b20b

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR).

NS(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)NC[C@@H]1CCCO1,WIL-NOV-066c4001-1,"Wilian Cortopassi, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR)","Rationale: The binding site of MPro_x1086 and MPro_x1187 connects two highly flexible termini regions of MPro. In other coronaviruses, e.g. SARS-CoV, these termini regions were shown to play an important role in protease activity and dimerization.(1,2) This idea here presented consists in merging these two fragments to explore distinct networks of hydrogen bonds and a pi-pi stacking with Phe8. A minimized complex with this new proposed ligand in MPro is available (attached). It shows hydrogen bonds with the backbone of Met6, T-shaped pi-pi interactions with Phe8 and a cation-pi interaction between the phenyl ring of the molecule and Arg298. This would provide a lead compound for Mpro inhibition, with significant room for ligand optimization.
Methodology: An initial visual inspection identified the pocket of MPro_x1086 and MPro_x1187 among the very few outside of the protease activity pocket of MPro that is not fully solvent exposed, and therefore it provides room for ligand optimization. MPro_x1086 forms a unique hydrogen bond with the backbone of Met6, and its phenyl group forms a pi-pi interaction with Phe8. Furthermore, its –NH2 group is close enough to the side chain of Asp295, raising the possibility of additional H-bonds. MPro_x1187 also forms pi-pi stacking with Phe8, while its amide group is not very far from Asn299. Therefore, a hybrid molecule consisting of these two fragments was built, and further minimized in MPro.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION: Fluorination (at the 3 position of the tetrahydroquinoline core) to increase ligand volume occupancy with no disruption of the water network surrounding the binding pocket (MD simulation analysis). Methylation at the 4 position of the tetrahydroquinoline core. The methyl group will adopt an equatorial preferred orientation (i.e. Crystallography Open Database ref. 2213899) impacting favourably ligand binding both from an enthalpic and entropic contributions (i.e. Biophys J. 2015 Feb 17; 108(4): 928–936). Similarly, a polar lipophilic pocket compatible unit, such as a nitrile (R-CN, where R is an aromatic group) has also been seen to occupy that subpocket (fragment x0305). No step-change in activities between the two enantiomers has been predicted. A single methyl group substituent will tend to adopt an axial preferred orientation.  Gem-dimethyl group at the 4 position of the tetrahydroquinoline core is tolerated. Fluorination at the 5 position is placed in a mildly polar region of the binding pocket (small but significant enthalpic contribution). The alkyl portion of the tetrahydropyranyl moiety (position 1 of the tetrahydroquinoline) is able to interact with the Met49 side chain (hydrophobic interaction) while exposing the polar cyclic ether moiety towards the solvent exposed region. In particular the tetrahydropyran oxygen is interacting with the Ser46 side chain (favorable polar interaction). Such an interaction is quite solvent exposed therefore providing a negligible impact (enthalpic contribution) to the ligand binding energy. The tetrahydropyran oxygen is located in an overlapping region to the carbonyl oxygen of the N-acyl piperazine moiety (structure ref. x0354).

In order to reduce a potential CYP induction liability a sulfonamide to the sulfoximine transformation was applied (Org. Chem. Front., 2019,6, 1319-1324). The S-attached methyl group of the chiral group (S enantiomer) is interacting with Pro168, while the S-attached oxygen atom is directed towards a more solvent exposed area. The sulfoximine NH is interacting with the Glu166 backbone (Hydrogen bond) and thus having a similar protein-ligand interaction pattern of the parent fragment. Pyridine nitrogen can interact with water molecule W116.","x0195,x0305",https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/DAV-AUT-fa25ac7f

FCc1ccccc1Cc1cccc(CS)c1,AMI-SHA-7fcb2bd6-1,"Amir Bitran, Shakhnovich lab, Harvard University","We have been taking a unique approach to this problem. Rather than targeting the Sars Cov2 protease in the native state, we are attempting to stabilize folding intermediates by designing compounds that are predicted to bind non-native cavities within these intermediates, thus stabilizing them. Our approach is akin to allosteric drug design, except that we aim to stabilize less structured states which may be prone to proteolytic degradation and/or aggregation in the cell. We expect it may be harder for the virus to evolve resistance to such compounds, as nonnative cavities often involve residues that are buried in the native state--thus, mutation of these residues may be detrimental to native stability. We model folding intermediates of a single subunit of the protease's N-terminal domain, on the assumptions that the domains fold independently, and dimerization precedes subunit folding. To predict these intermediates, we apply the algorithm in (1) (see Notes), which can rapidly simulate folding of complex proteins at the atomistic level while accounting for non-native states. We then grow compounds that are predicted to bind  these intermediates at specific cavities using the OpenGrowth algorithm detailed in (2), keeping only compounds that predicted to bind with sub-micromolar affinity whose synthetic accessibility is less than 4.0, and which are predicted to bind a large number of representative snapshots assigned to a given folding intermediate with a similar binding profile, as computed using the AlphaSpace method (3). Three such compounds, each bound to a predicted folding intermed",x0072,https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/AMI-SHA-7fcb2bd6

This module consists of two functional parts. The first provides pharmacophore-based mapping of targeted cavity by molecular fragments (probes) with their further minimization. The second subprogram provides step-by-step linking of building blocks to the probes, taking into account the protein environment. Since ligands of crystal structures acted as initial probes in current experiment, only the second part of QSB module was used.
As starting molecules, ligands from 5REY, 5REN, 5RFG crystals were used. Model was built based on protein structure from 6LU7 crystal. Libraries of building blocks were obtained by fragmentation of molecules from Enamine 10K diverse collection with BRICS algorithm.
Five stages of structure building have been completed. In the first two stages, libraries of larger fragments (linkers) were used in order to extend the scaffold structure. At each of these two consecutive steps, the top 20 structures were selected by the module based on calculated energy values and then the top 5 of them were selected for further calculations based on expert evaluation. The next 3 stages were aimed at linking small functional groups and were performed automatically. During the first two stages the 5 best structures were automatically selected for the next step. At the final step, the 20 best structures in terms of energy were retained.",x1311,https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/INS-INS-714f82db

The reference structure was compound 35 from 2011Akaji, which is a tetrapeptide transition state mimic for SARS-CoV(-1), with an IC50 of 98 nM [1]. The intent of this work-package was to try and find some non-peptide mimics.

The generative part of the method is based on Jan Jensen's python GB-GA (https://github.com/jensengroup/GB-GA), but with a custom similarly metric that provides a smooth continuous scoring including chemical specificity between 3D structures. Each step of the GA evaluated 42 conformers (generated with open-babel, scored with RMSD) of the trial compound, then maximised the 3D chemical overlap of these conformers against the reference molecule in a single 3D pose. The highest conformer score was used in the GA. The algorithm takes approximately 5 cpu seconds per molecule, which is mostly linear in the number of conformers that are checked.

18145 separate GA streams with a population size of 50 and 100 generations were seeded with the MPro-XChem hits (i.e. all fragments) and the first 1000 molecules of ZINC, and scored with a purely electrostatic chemical similarity. The elite (highest scoring) structures from these runs were then used to seed a second round of 9525 GA streams, where the metric additionally included a score of vdW dispersion chemical specificity (scored at the best electrostatic match), where these multiple objectives were scalarised by taking a weighted geometric mean (electrostatic^0.8 * dispersion^0.2). So the molecules here are the best of ~138 million evaluated molecules, after 200 generations of evolution.

The final outputs were simply ranked by the scoring function, and approx. 30% discarded by a simple RDKIT 'problematic group' filter. Clearly the algorithm has been rather keen to put lots of heteroatoms (O,N,S) in place, in order to reproduce a chemical similarity to the peptide backbone. No analysis of stability was made. 

No chemist has adjusted or post-processed these structures. Clearly much is missing from the metric - and any suggestions on how to 'fix' a structure with some obviously problematic hetero atoms / groups would be greatly appreciated! These could then be easily re-scored, to see whether the metric still thought they were similar.

This work was done in collaboration with Kuano Ltd, and used computer time on the Imperial College Research Computing Service,  DOI: [10.14469/hpc/2232](http://doi.org/10.14469/hpc/2232). 

The overall aim of this work is to characterise the transition states of the actual substrates of 3CL-pro, and then use this GB-GA generative method, and a suitably developed metric to direct suggest transition state analogues. Future work will be to develop the metrics to make closer analogues, and with Kuano to build a robust platform with more sophisticated synthesis likelihood & stability filters.

The reference structure was compound 35 from 2011Akaji, which is a tetrapeptide transition state mimic for SARS-CoV(-1), with an IC50 of 98 nM [1]. The intent of this work-package was to try and find some non-peptide mimics.

The generative part of the method is based on Jan Jensen's python GB-GA (https://github.com/jensengroup/GB-GA), but with a custom similarly metric that provides a smooth continuous scoring including chemical specificity between 3D structures. Each step of the GA evaluated 42 conformers (generated with open-babel, scored with RMSD) of the trial compound, then maximised the 3D chemical overlap of these conformers against the reference molecule in a single 3D pose. The highest conformer score was used in the GA. The algorithm takes approximately 5 cpu seconds per molecule, which is mostly linear in the number of conformers that are checked.

18145 separate GA streams with a population size of 50 and 100 generations were seeded with the MPro-XChem hits (i.e. all fragments) and the first 1000 molecules of ZINC, and scored with a purely electrostatic chemical similarity. The elite (highest scoring) structures from these runs were then used to seed a second round of 9525 GA streams, where the metric additionally included a score of vdW dispersion chemical specificity (scored at the best electrostatic match), where these multiple objectives were scalarised by taking a weighted geometric mean (electrostatic^0.8 * dispersion^0.2). So the molecules here are the best of ~138 million evaluated molecules, after 200 generations of evolution.

The final outputs were simply ranked by the scoring function, and approx. 30% discarded by a simple RDKIT 'problematic group' filter. Clearly the algorithm has been rather keen to put lots of heteroatoms (O,N,S) in place, in order to reproduce a chemical similarity to the peptide backbone. No analysis of stability was made. 

No chemist has adjusted or post-processed these structures. Clearly much is missing from the metric - and any suggestions on how to 'fix' a structure with some obviously problematic hetero atoms / groups would be greatly appreciated! These could then be easily re-scored, to see whether the metric still thought they were similar.

The overall aim of this work is to characterise the transition states of the actual substrates of 3CL-pro, and then use this GB-GA generative method, and a suitably developed metric to direct suggest transition state analogues. Future work will be to develop the metrics to make closer analogues, and with Kuano to build a robust platform with more sophisticated synthesis likelihood & stability filters.

18145 separate GA streams with a population size of 50 and 100 generations were seeded with the MPro-XChem hits (i.e. all fragments) and the first 1000 molecules of ZINC, and scored with a purely electrostatic chemical similarity. The elite (highest scoring) structures from these runs were then used to seed a second round of 9525 GA streams, where the metric additionally included a score of vdW dispersion chemical specificity (scored at the best electrostatic match), where these multiple objectives were scalarised by taking a weighted geometric mean (electrostatic^0.8 * dispersion^0.2). So the molecules here are the best of ~138 million evaluated molecules, after 200 generations of evolution.

The final outputs were simply ranked by the scoring function, and approx. 30% discarded by a simple RDKIT 'problematic group' filter. Clearly the algorithm has been rather keen to put lots of heteroatoms (O,N,S) in place, in order to reproduce a chemical similarity to the peptide backbone. No analysis of stability was made. 

No chemist has adjusted or post-processed these structures. Clearly much is missing from the metric - and any suggestions on how to 'fix' a structure with some obviously problematic hetero atoms / groups would be greatly appreciated! These could then be easily re-scored, to see whether the metric still thought they were similar.

The overall aim of this work is to characterise the transition states of the actual substrates of 3CL-pro, and then use this GB-GA generative method, and a suitably developed metric to direct suggest transition state analogues. Future work will be to develop the metrics to make closer analogues, and with Kuano to build a robust platform with more sophisticated synthesis likelihood & stability filters.

The reference structure was compound 35 from 2011Akaji, which is a tetrapeptide transition state mimic for SARS-CoV(-1), with an IC50 of 98 nM [1]. The intent of this work-package was to try and find some non-peptide mimics.

The generative part of the method is based on Jan Jensen's python GB-GA (https://github.com/jensengroup/GB-GA), but with a custom similarly metric that provides a smooth continuous scoring including chemical specificity between 3D structures. Each step of the GA evaluated 42 conformers (generated with open-babel, scored with RMSD) of the trial compound, then maximised the 3D chemical overlap of these conformers against the reference molecule in a single 3D pose. The highest conformer score was used in the GA. The algorithm takes approximately 5 cpu seconds per molecule, which is mostly linear in the number of conformers that are checked.

18145 separate GA streams with a population size of 50 and 100 generations were seeded with the MPro-XChem hits (i.e. all fragments) and the first 1000 molecules of ZINC, and scored with a purely electrostatic chemical similarity. The elite (highest scoring) structures from these runs were then used to seed a second round of 9525 GA streams, where the metric additionally included a score of vdW dispersion chemical specificity (scored at the best electrostatic match), where these multiple objectives were scalarised by taking a weighted geometric mean (electrostatic^0.8 * dispersion^0.2). So the molecules here are the best of ~138 million evaluated molecules, after 200 generations of evolution.

The final outputs were simply ranked by the scoring function, and approx. 30% discarded by a simple RDKIT 'problematic group' filter. Clearly the algorithm has been rather keen to put lots of heteroatoms (O,N,S) in place, in order to reproduce a chemical similarity to the peptide backbone. No analysis of stability was made. 

No chemist has adjusted or post-processed these structures. Clearly much is missing from the metric - and any suggestions on how to 'fix' a structure with some obviously problematic hetero atoms / groups would be greatly appreciated! These could then be easily re-scored, to see whether the metric still thought they were similar.

In two tweaks the code, this run initialised on the fly from the elite (top scoring) of previous GA runs (effectively chaining together otherwise parallel runs), and a tweak was made to the tournament scoring to increase diversity. (Overall, 100 million molecules were generated and scored.)

These submitted molecules were hand-picked from the top few hundred scoring molecules overall, as they had these unusual fused macrocycles which the scoring algorithm believes is similar to the middle of Boceprevir, and then with alternatives for the peptide like sidechains.

The reference molecule was Boceprevir. This the result from an overnight run of 40'000 streams of the GA each running 25 generations with a population of 100. The GAs start with a set of all the Diamond fragments, and a thousand molecules from ZINC. 
In two tweaks the code, this run initialised on the fly from the elite (top scoring) of previous GA runs (effectively chaining together otherwise parallel runs), and a tweak was made to the tournament scoring to increase diversity. (Overall, 100 million molecules were generated and scored.)

These and eleven more Mpro structures [4] from the PDB were overlaid so as to determine active site residues displaying the largest degree of disorder which were then used to define flexible side chains for inclusion in the docking calculations. Virtual docking was performed with Autodock Vina [5] using protein and MBC compound structures prepared using MGLtools [6], OpenBabel [7] and RDKit [8]. Docking was performed against both crystal structures with/without flexible active site side chains. The best compounds were selected based on overall docking scores and predicted bioavailability.[9] The structures in this submission are predicted to be absorbed in the GI tract but are not predicted to cross the blood-brain barrier. In addition, all are listed as commercially available in the ZINC database.

Due to the known flexibility of SARS-CoV(-2) Mpro,[1,2] two crystal structures were selected from the PDB to provide different overall active site geometries, 6Y2E and 6Y2G [3]. These and eleven more Mpro structures [4] from the PDB were overlaid so as to determine active site residues displaying the largest degree of disorder which were then used to define flexible side chains for inclusion in the docking calculations. Virtual docking was performed with Autodock Vina [5] using protein and MBC compound structures prepared using MGLtools [6], OpenBabel [7] and RDKit [8]. Docking was performed against both crystal structures with/without flexible active site side chains. The best compounds were selected based on overall docking scores and predicted bioavailability.[9] The structures in this submission are predicted to be absorbed in the GI tract but are not predicted to cross the blood-brain barrier. In addition, all are listed as commercially available in the ZINC database.

Due to the known flexibility of SARS-CoV(-2) Mpro,[1,2] two crystal structures were selected from the PDB to provide different overall active site geometries, 6Y2E and 6Y2G [3]. These and eleven more Mpro structures [4] from the PDB were overlaid so as to determine active site residues displaying the largest degree of disorder which were then used to define flexible side chains for inclusion in the docking calculations. Virtual docking was performed with Autodock Vina [5] using protein and MBC compound structures prepared using MGLtools [6], OpenBabel [7] and RDKit [8]. Docking was performed against both crystal structures with/without flexible active site side chains. The best compounds were selected based on overall docking scores and predicted bioavailability.[9] The structures in this submission are predicted to be absorbed in the GI tract and to cross the blood-brain barrier. In addition, all are listed as commercially available in the ZINC database.

Strategy: Optimize potency from structurally-enabled inhibitor, TG-0205221.

TG-0205221 (has a cyclohexyl instead of the proposed ideas with a piperidine) data shows: SARS CLpro Ki 53 nM, and SARS Vero-E6 Cell EC50 600 nM. From the crystal structure (PDB:2GX4), the inhibitor binds in the cleft between Protomer B and C of the dimer (binds in each asymmetric unit). From the crystal structure, most (5 of 6) of the hydrogen bonds are with Protomer C. The idea is to boost potency by substituting the cyclohexyl moiety for a basic amine (piperdine). The cyclohexyl seems to snake down the S2 pocket in Protomer B where the terminus is a Tyrosine residue (Tyr54). Based off of the model of the piperdine compared to the crystal structure of TG-0205221, the basic amine could sit over the tyrosine and form a hydrogen bond to boost potency. From heavy atom to heavy atom they are 2.8 angstrom away. Not the ideal length for a hydrogen bond but could potentially give you some boost in activity.  This could be an efficient substitution that doesn't require larger decorations to the molecule and gives a quick go/no-go on this hypothesis. 

Although this molecule has a number of structure alerts, its structure is similar to molecules that at least made it into Phase 1 clinical trials.",x0072,https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/SIM-TAK-0ea87db9

Data can be found on drive (poses, top scoring cmps):
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FzCPYDOHTMLqKxfPJQIP0tIzxeVhHd4L

With the following modifications:
1. A new query (query2 on drive) was created on the basis of BAR-COM-4e0-39 & TRY-UNI-714-6
2. A model (fusedmodel_noLig on drive) was created on the basis of those xrays flipping some side chains to allow the docking of molecules going into the pocket that BAR-COM-4e0-39 goes. Two water molecules were kept.
3. Shape based constraints were used in the docking
3. SPLIF score >0.5 and docking _score <-7.5 was used (SPLIF.sdf.gz on drive)
4. DISE clustering +visual inspection to increase diversity, selection of 61 compounds (selected2.sdf.gz on drive)
5. a selection of 5 high scoring compounds on basis of docking score (selected1.sdf.gz on drive)

I'm aware that some cmps have structural alerts, but I think those features we can remove once we have more potent hits (i.e. the Br/N-N linked compounds)

With the following modifications:
1. A new query (query2 on drive) was created on the basis of BAR-COM-4e0-39 & TRY-UNI-714-6
2. A model (fusedmodel_noLig on drive) was created on the basis of those xrays flipping some side chains to allow the docking of molecules going into the pocket that BAR-COM-4e0-39 goes. Two water molecules were kept.
3. Shape based constraints were used in the docking
3. SPLIF score >0.5 and docking _score <-7.5 was used (SPLIF.sdf.gz on drive)
4. DISE clustering +visual inspection to increase diversity, selection of 61 compounds (selected2.sdf.gz on drive)
5. a selection of 5 high scoring compounds on basis of docking score (selected1.sdf.gz on drive)

I'm aware that some cmps have structural alerts, but I think those features we can remove once we have more potent hits (i.e. the Br/N-N linked compounds)

With the following modifications:
1. A new query (query2 on drive) was created on the basis of BAR-COM-4e0-39 & TRY-UNI-714-6
2. A model (fusedmodel_noLig on drive) was created on the basis of those xrays flipping some side chains to allow the docking of molecules going into the pocket that BAR-COM-4e0-39 goes. Two water molecules were kept.
3. Shape based constraints were used in the docking
3. SPLIF score >0.5 and docking _score <-7.5 was used (SPLIF.sdf.gz on drive)
4. DISE clustering +visual inspection to increase diversity, selection of 61 compounds (selected2.sdf.gz on drive)
5. a selection of 5 high scoring compounds on basis of docking score (selected1.sdf.gz on drive)

I'm aware that some cmps have structural alerts, but I think those features we can remove once we have more potent hits (i.e. the Br/N-N linked compounds)

Data can be found on drive (poses, top scoring cmps):

With the following modifications:
1. A new query (query2 on drive) was created on the basis of BAR-COM-4e0-39 & TRY-UNI-714-6
2. A model (fusedmodel_noLig on drive) was created on the basis of those xrays flipping some side chains to allow the docking of molecules going into the pocket that BAR-COM-4e0-39 goes. Two water molecules were kept.
3. Shape based constraints were used in the docking
3. SPLIF score >0.5 and docking _score <-7.5 was used (SPLIF.sdf.gz on drive)
4. DISE clustering +visual inspection to increase diversity, selection of 61 compounds (selected2.sdf.gz on drive)
5. a selection of 5 high scoring compounds on basis of docking score (selected1.sdf.gz on drive)

I'm aware that some cmps have structural alerts, but I think those features we can remove once we have more potent hits (i.e. the Br/N-N linked compounds)

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FzCPYDOHTMLqKxfPJQIP0tIzxeVhHd4L

With the following modifications:
1. A new query (query2 on drive) was created on the basis of BAR-COM-4e0-39 & TRY-UNI-714-6
2. A model (fusedmodel_noLig on drive) was created on the basis of those xrays flipping some side chains to allow the docking of molecules going into the pocket that BAR-COM-4e0-39 goes. Two water molecules were kept.
3. Shape based constraints were used in the docking
3. SPLIF score >0.5 and docking _score <-7.5 was used (SPLIF.sdf.gz on drive)
4. DISE clustering +visual inspection to increase diversity, selection of 61 compounds (selected2.sdf.gz on drive)
5. a selection of 5 high scoring compounds on basis of docking score (selected1.sdf.gz on drive)

I'm aware that some cmps have structural alerts, but I think those features we can remove once we have more potent hits (i.e. the Br/N-N linked compounds)

With the following modifications:
1. A new query (query2 on drive) was created on the basis of BAR-COM-4e0-39 & TRY-UNI-714-6
2. A model (fusedmodel_noLig on drive) was created on the basis of those xrays flipping some side chains to allow the docking of molecules going into the pocket that BAR-COM-4e0-39 goes. Two water molecules were kept.
3. Shape based constraints were used in the docking
3. SPLIF score >0.5 and docking _score <-7.5 was used (SPLIF.sdf.gz on drive)
4. DISE clustering +visual inspection to increase diversity, selection of 61 compounds (selected2.sdf.gz on drive)
5. a selection of 5 high scoring compounds on basis of docking score (selected1.sdf.gz on drive)

I'm aware that some cmps have structural alerts, but I think those features we can remove once we have more potent hits (i.e. the Br/N-N linked compounds)

With the following modifications:
1. A new query (query2 on drive) was created on the basis of BAR-COM-4e0-39 & TRY-UNI-714-6
2. A model (fusedmodel_noLig on drive) was created on the basis of those xrays flipping some side chains to allow the docking of molecules going into the pocket that BAR-COM-4e0-39 goes. Two water molecules were kept.
3. Shape based constraints were used in the docking
3. SPLIF score >0.5 and docking _score <-7.5 was used (SPLIF.sdf.gz on drive)
4. DISE clustering +visual inspection to increase diversity, selection of 61 compounds (selected2.sdf.gz on drive)
5. a selection of 5 high scoring compounds on basis of docking score (selected1.sdf.gz on drive)

I'm aware that some cmps have structural alerts, but I think those features we can remove once we have more potent hits (i.e. the Br/N-N linked compounds)

2. A model (fusedmodel_noLig on drive) was created on the basis of those xrays flipping some side chains to allow the docking of molecules going into the pocket that BAR-COM-4e0-39 goes. Two water molecules were kept.
3. Shape based constraints were used in the docking
3. SPLIF score >0.5 and docking _score <-7.5 was used (SPLIF.sdf.gz on drive)
4. DISE clustering +visual inspection to increase diversity, selection of 61 compounds (selected2.sdf.gz on drive)
5. a selection of 5 high scoring compounds on basis of docking score (selected1.sdf.gz on drive)

I'm aware that some cmps have structural alerts, but I think those features we can remove once we have more potent hits (i.e. the Br/N-N linked compounds)

With the following modifications:
1. A new query (query2 on drive) was created on the basis of BAR-COM-4e0-39 & TRY-UNI-714-6
2. A model (fusedmodel_noLig on drive) was created on the basis of those xrays flipping some side chains to allow the docking of molecules going into the pocket that BAR-COM-4e0-39 goes. Two water molecules were kept.
3. Shape based constraints were used in the docking
3. SPLIF score >0.5 and docking _score <-7.5 was used (SPLIF.sdf.gz on drive)
4. DISE clustering +visual inspection to increase diversity, selection of 61 compounds (selected2.sdf.gz on drive)
5. a selection of 5 high scoring compounds on basis of docking score (selected1.sdf.gz on drive)

I'm aware that some cmps have structural alerts, but I think those features we can remove once we have more potent hits (i.e. the Br/N-N linked compounds)

With the following modifications:
1. A new query (query2 on drive) was created on the basis of BAR-COM-4e0-39 & TRY-UNI-714-6
2. A model (fusedmodel_noLig on drive) was created on the basis of those xrays flipping some side chains to allow the docking of molecules going into the pocket that BAR-COM-4e0-39 goes. Two water molecules were kept.
3. Shape based constraints were used in the docking
3. SPLIF score >0.5 and docking _score <-7.5 was used (SPLIF.sdf.gz on drive)
4. DISE clustering +visual inspection to increase diversity, selection of 61 compounds (selected2.sdf.gz on drive)
5. a selection of 5 high scoring compounds on basis of docking score (selected1.sdf.gz on drive)

I'm aware that some cmps have structural alerts, but I think those features we can remove once we have more potent hits (i.e. the Br/N-N linked compounds)

With the following modifications:
1. A new query (query2 on drive) was created on the basis of BAR-COM-4e0-39 & TRY-UNI-714-6
2. A model (fusedmodel_noLig on drive) was created on the basis of those xrays flipping some side chains to allow the docking of molecules going into the pocket that BAR-COM-4e0-39 goes. Two water molecules were kept.
3. Shape based constraints were used in the docking
3. SPLIF score >0.5 and docking _score <-7.5 was used (SPLIF.sdf.gz on drive)
4. DISE clustering +visual inspection to increase diversity, selection of 61 compounds (selected2.sdf.gz on drive)
5. a selection of 5 high scoring compounds on basis of docking score (selected1.sdf.gz on drive)

I'm aware that some cmps have structural alerts, but I think those features we can remove once we have more potent hits (i.e. the Br/N-N linked compounds)

With the following modifications:
1. A new query (query2 on drive) was created on the basis of BAR-COM-4e0-39 & TRY-UNI-714-6
2. A model (fusedmodel_noLig on drive) was created on the basis of those xrays flipping some side chains to allow the docking of molecules going into the pocket that BAR-COM-4e0-39 goes. Two water molecules were kept.
3. Shape based constraints were used in the docking
3. SPLIF score >0.5 and docking _score <-7.5 was used (SPLIF.sdf.gz on drive)
4. DISE clustering +visual inspection to increase diversity, selection of 61 compounds (selected2.sdf.gz on drive)
5. a selection of 5 high scoring compounds on basis of docking score (selected1.sdf.gz on drive)

I'm aware that some cmps have structural alerts, but I think those features we can remove once we have more potent hits (i.e. the Br/N-N linked compounds)

With the following modifications:
1. A new query (query2 on drive) was created on the basis of BAR-COM-4e0-39 & TRY-UNI-714-6
2. A model (fusedmodel_noLig on drive) was created on the basis of those xrays flipping some side chains to allow the docking of molecules going into the pocket that BAR-COM-4e0-39 goes. Two water molecules were kept.
3. Shape based constraints were used in the docking
3. SPLIF score >0.5 and docking _score <-7.5 was used (SPLIF.sdf.gz on drive)
4. DISE clustering +visual inspection to increase diversity, selection of 61 compounds (selected2.sdf.gz on drive)
5. a selection of 5 high scoring compounds on basis of docking score (selected1.sdf.gz on drive)

I'm aware that some cmps have structural alerts, but I think those features we can remove once we have more potent hits (i.e. the Br/N-N linked compounds)
