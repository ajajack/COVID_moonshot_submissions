We converted it to a peptidomimetic molecule with a Michael acceptor for covalent bonding to Cys145 and docked it onto 6y2e PDB using rosetta ligand docking. The approximate ligand docking protocol is as follows, 
1. First we used SiteHound to identify posssible ligand binding sites in 6y2e using a Methyl probe. Three binding sites were found but only the active site showed the highest score qualifying for the subsequent docking run. 
2. The ligand was placed close to 6y2e at the XYZ coordinates obtained for high scoring solution from SiteHound. 10,000 docking poses were generated by restricting the ligand to a box of 10 Å radius and perturbing (rotation + translation) the ligand 5 Å. Rosetta calculated the interface_delta score which is approximate measure of the interaction between the ligand and the protein. Top 10 solution sorted using interface_delta score were manually inspected in pymol. All 10 solutions docked the ligand in the active site.

- The C-term Phe occupies hydrophobic pocket formed by residues M165, L167, F185 and V186
- Arg forms a salt-bridge to E166 and another polar contact to the backbone carbonyls of residues L167 and P168.

This made me immediately think of benzenesulfonamide drugs as there are a few of those. Among them, Hydrochlorothiazide seems to both nicely fulfil the benzensulfonamide pharmacophore as the N of the secondary sulfonamide also so-localizes with the tertiary amine of a few other fragments (e.g. x0354).

So, on the one side, you could potentially cocrystalize Hydrochlorothiazide alone and explore it for repurposing. On the other hand, as the compound is commercial, you could use it as a scaffold. I have used it as a scaffold in the molecule I sketched and explored whether I could add a pyridine with a linker to reach the pyridine hotspot. I think the linker I used would be the ideal length but you could explore several other linkers as well. I believe it should be possible to derivatize the sulfonamide but it's true that this could be challenging given there is another sulfonamide in the structure that could cross-react.

However, there is no crystal structure of the 2019-nCoV main protease with either of these two drugs that could clarify their potential for optimization against this target. Thus, I suggest lopinavir, ritonavir, and reasonably similar substructures available from catalog for soaking.

Procedure in KNIME:

1) search all substructures of lopinavir and ritonavir in MolPort
2) remove all redundant compounds and compounds with similarity < 0.5 (datawarrior SkelPheres) to either of the queries
3) remove all compounds void of a ring or containing amides (as substructures of amides)

 Notes on the chemical profile:

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well. RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy units (REU). MoleculeComplexity is a metric by Ertl. et al., 2009, Journal of Cheminformatics, and generally less than 2.5 indicates the molecule is reasonably synthesizable.","x0107,x1384",https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/BEN-VAN-5787f7d3,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,381.3820000000002,3.6129200000000017,0,4,55.2,0,PASS,2-halo pyridine,PASS,Filter94_2_halo_pyridine,PASS,2-halopyridine,PASS,PASS,PASS,IDKAAPNAQBKMIW,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well. RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy units (REU). MoleculeComplexity is a metric by Ertl. et al., 2009, Journal of Cheminformatics, and generally less than 2.5 indicates the molecule is reasonably synthesizable.","x0107,x1384",https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/BEN-VAN-5787f7d3,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,345.40200000000016,3.3347200000000017,0,4,55.2,0,PASS,PASS,PASS,PASS,PASS,PASS,PASS,PASS,PASS,MIKCNICUQAHCNJ,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well. RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy units (REU).

 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer.

Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score.

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score.

 Notes on the chemical profile:

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well.

 Notes on the chemical profile:

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations.

 Notes on the chemical profile:

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score.

 Notes on the chemical profile:

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score.

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score.

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score.

 Notes on the chemical profile:

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations.

 Notes on the chemical profile:

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors.

The second subprogram provides step-by-step linking of building blocks to the probes, taking into account the protein environment. Since ligands of crystal structures acted as initial probes in current experiment, only the second part of QSB module was used.
As starting molecule, ligand from 5REL crystal was used. Model was built based on protein structure from 6LU7 crystal. Libraries of building blocks were obtained by fragmentation of molecules from Enamine 10K diverse collection with BRICS algorithm.
Five stages of structure building have been completed. In the first two stages, libraries of larger fragments (linkers) were used in order to extend the scaffold structure. At each of these two consecutive steps, the top 20 structures were selected by the module based on calculated energy values and then the top 5 of them were selected for further calculations based on expert evaluation.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION: A Nitrile group, placed at ortho-position to the sulfonamide moiety of fragment x0161, is able to fit a sub pocket located where water molecule W116 (Structure x0336) is located. This substitution can impact favourably ligand binding both from an enthalpic and entropic contributions (i.e. Biophys J. 2015 Feb 17; 108(4): 928–936). 

Alternatively the Nitrile group can be replaced by a cyclic N-acyl sulfoximine core. It is able to fit a sub pocket located where W116 (Structure x0336) is located. The carbonyl oxygen at the cyclic N-acyl sulfoximine core is able to interact (H bond) with the Gln192 side chain and Thr190 backbone. This group is located in an overlapping region to the occupied volume by the sulfoxide oxigen of DMS901 (structure x0354). The S-attached methyl group of the chiral core (R enantiomer) is interacting with Pro168, while the S-attached oxygen atom is (favourably) directed towards a more solvent exposed area of the binding pocket. 

At the para-position (to the S-attached sulfoximine substituent) of the aromatic ring, the binding pocket is more shallow and able to accommodate several different structural motifs. Bulky, sp3 rich motifs should be well tolerated in this region and could enable the ideation of structurally diverse lead molecules with good solubility and PK properties. 

A set 7 and 8 membered rings structures derived from the Crystallography Open Database (stripped of major substituents) were rigidly docked to assess the potential fit to this accessory binding pocket. This approach was used in order to avoid incurring MM minimization artifacts and to quickly get a flavour of interesting substituents worth exploring. The 1,4-oxazepine derivative is inspired from the Crystallography Open Database (ref. 1100289) after QM optimization. The N-attached methyl group is fitting into the hydrophobic pocket delimited by Met165 and Phe181 side chains. Similarly, a polar lipophilic pocket compatible unit, such as a nitrile (R-CN, where R is an aromatic group) has also been seen to explore such a region (fragment  x0305). The methyl group attached to the carbon at the 3 position of the oxazepinone is interacting with the Met165 side chain. The oxygen (position 1 of the oxazepinone) is almost coplanar to the aromatic ring, towards the solvent exposed area of the binding pocket.  The carbonyl oxygen is placed in a mild polar binding pocket, interacting with a conserved water molecule (W6). Some of the reported oxazepinones might be challenging to synthesize or introduce unwanted complexity in the designed compound (i.e. 3 chiral centers).
 
Alternatively, a sulfonamide to a non cyclic acyl sulfoximine transformation was applied. The S-attached methyl group of the chiral group (S enantiomer) is interacting with Pro168, while the S-attached oxygen atom is directed towards a more solvent exposed area. The carbonyl oxygen of the acyl group is interacting with W39 and the amide NH is hydrogen bonded with Glu166 backbone. Pyridine nitrogen is interacting with water molecules W116.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION: A Nitrile group, placed at ortho-position to the sulfonamide moiety of fragment x0161, is able to fit a sub pocket located where water molecule W116 (Structure x0336) is located. This substitution can impact favourably ligand binding both from an enthalpic and entropic contributions (i.e. Biophys J. 2015 Feb 17; 108(4): 928–936). 

Alternatively the Nitrile group can be replaced by a cyclic N-acyl sulfoximine core. It is able to fit a sub pocket located where W116 (Structure x0336) is located. The carbonyl oxygen at the cyclic N-acyl sulfoximine core is able to interact (H bond) with the Gln192 side chain and Thr190 backbone. This group is located in an overlapping region to the occupied volume by the sulfoxide oxigen of DMS901 (structure x0354). The S-attached methyl group of the chiral core (R enantiomer) is interacting with Pro168, while the S-attached oxygen atom is (favourably) directed towards a more solvent exposed area of the binding pocket. 

At the para-position (to the S-attached sulfoximine substituent) of the aromatic ring, the binding pocket is more shallow and able to accommodate several different structural motifs. Bulky, sp3 rich motifs should be well tolerated in this region and could enable the ideation of structurally diverse lead molecules with good solubility and PK properties. 

A set 7 and 8 membered rings structures derived from the Crystallography Open Database (stripped of major substituents) were rigidly docked to assess the potential fit to this accessory binding pocket. This approach was used in order to avoid incurring MM minimization artifacts and to quickly get a flavour of interesting substituents worth exploring. The 1,4-oxazepine derivative is inspired from the Crystallography Open Database (ref. 1100289) after QM optimization. The N-attached methyl group is fitting into the hydrophobic pocket delimited by Met165 and Phe181 side chains. Similarly, a polar lipophilic pocket compatible unit, such as a nitrile (R-CN, where R is an aromatic group) has also been seen to explore such a region (fragment  x0305). The methyl group attached to the carbon at the 3 position of the oxazepinone is interacting with the Met165 side chain. The oxygen (position 1 of the oxazepinone) is almost coplanar to the aromatic ring, towards the solvent exposed area of the binding pocket.  The carbonyl oxygen is placed in a mild polar binding pocket, interacting with a conserved water molecule (W6). Some of the reported oxazepinones might be challenging to synthesize or introduce unwanted complexity in the designed compound (i.e. 3 chiral centers).
 
Alternatively, a sulfonamide to a non cyclic acyl sulfoximine transformation was applied. The S-attached methyl group of the chiral group (S enantiomer) is interacting with Pro168, while the S-attached oxygen atom is directed towards a more solvent exposed area. The carbonyl oxygen of the acyl group is interacting with W39 and the amide NH is hydrogen bonded with Glu166 backbone. Pyridine nitrogen is interacting with water molecules W116.

With this aim, we took from e-Drug3D (https://chemoinfo.ipmc.cnrs.fr/MOLDB/index.php) all the 1930 molecular structures approved between 1939 and 2019 by the FDA with a molecular weight ≤ 2000 Da and docked them at the binding site of 6LU7 structure by using three different docking programs (i.e., GlideSP, FRED and VINA). For each ligand and docking program, we have kept the top 10 docked poses (i.e., 10 for GlideSP, 10 for FRED and 10 for VINA). When considering 10 poses per ligand/program we assume that one of them will be the bioactive one (although the score function not always have ranked it as the first one). Finally the bioactive pose is assumed to be identified if it has been found simultaneously by the three programs (this means that the rmsd for each pairwise pose comparison is below 1.5 angstroms). Our idea here is that, in general, protein-ligand docking programs are really good when trying to look for the possible poses of a ligand in a binding site but usually fail to rank correctly such poses. Then, if three different protein-ligand programs find the same pose, this have a high probability to be the bioactive one.

Then, we applied a second filter in order to keep only those poses that are not only identified by the three programs but also show high affinity for M-pro. In order to find which threshold can be used to discriminate high from low affinity poses, we docked the 1577 compounds from the OTAVA Machine Learning SARS Targeted Library (https://otavachemicals.com/targets/sars-cov-2-targeted-libraries?utm_medium=email&utm_source=UniSender&utm_campaign=229613803) into the binding site of 6LU7 with GlideSP, FRED and VINA (with the identical set up conditions than were previously used for the 1930 FDA approved compounds). For this docking, we kept only the top-ranked pose obtained for each ligand by each programs. Then, we make three different histograms for the docking results of the OTAVA library (one per program) and arbitrarily selected as a threshold for distinguish from low to high M-pro affinity the lowest score value of the interval that contains the top 30% poses with the highest affinity. The resulting threshold was -6.3 for GlideSP, -7.0 for FRED and -7.5 for VINA. Then, all the poses that had succeed the first filter but had scores more positive than these threshold values were removed.

Then, only 5 FDA approved compounds simultaneously accomplished that: (1) the same pose is found independently by GlideSP, FRED and VINA; and (2) this pose has score values equal or more negative than the three mentioned thresholds.

With this aim, we took from e-Drug3D (https://chemoinfo.ipmc.cnrs.fr/MOLDB/index.php) all the 1930 molecular structures approved between 1939 and 2019 by the FDA with a molecular weight ≤ 2000 Da and docked them at the binding site of 6LU7 structure by using three different docking programs (i.e., GlideSP, FRED and VINA). For each ligand and docking program, we have kept the top 10 docked poses (i.e., 10 for GlideSP, 10 for FRED and 10 for VINA). When considering 10 poses per ligand/program we assume that one of them will be the bioactive one (although the score function not always have ranked it as the first one). Finally the bioactive pose is assumed to be identified if it has been found simultaneously by the three programs (this means that the rmsd for each pairwise pose comparison is below 1.5 angstroms). Our idea here is that, in general, protein-ligand docking programs are really good when trying to look for the possible poses of a ligand in a binding site but usually fail to rank correctly such poses. Then, if three different protein-ligand programs find the same pose, this have a high probability to be the bioactive one.

Then, we applied a second filter in order to keep only those poses that are not only identified by the three programs but also show high affinity for M-pro. In order to find which threshold can be used to discriminate high from low affinity poses, we docked the 1577 compounds from the OTAVA Machine Learning SARS Targeted Library (https://otavachemicals.com/targets/sars-cov-2-targeted-libraries?utm_medium=email&utm_source=UniSender&utm_campaign=229613803) into the binding site of 6LU7 with GlideSP, FRED and VINA (with the identical set up conditions than were previously used for the 1930 FDA approved compounds). For this docking, we kept only the top-ranked pose obtained for each ligand by each programs. Then, we make three different histograms for the docking results of the OTAVA library (one per program) and arbitrarily selected as a threshold for distinguish from low to high M-pro affinity the lowest score value of the interval that contains the top 30% poses with the highest affinity.

This module consists of two functional parts. The first provides pharmacophore-based mapping of targeted cavity by molecular fragments (probes) with their further minimization. The second subprogram provides step-by-step linking of building blocks to the probes, taking into account the protein environment. Since ligands of crystal structures acted as initial probes in current experiment, only the second part of QSB module was used.
As starting molecules, ligands from 5REY, 5REN, 5RFG crystals were used. Model was built based on protein structure from 6LU7 crystal. Libraries of building blocks were obtained by fragmentation of molecules from Enamine 10K diverse collection with BRICS algorithm.
Five stages of structure building have been completed. In the first two stages, libraries of larger fragments (linkers) were used in order to extend the scaffold structure. At each of these two consecutive steps, the top 20 structures were selected by the module based on calculated energy values and then the top 5 of them were selected for further calculations based on expert evaluation. The next 3 stages were aimed at linking small functional groups and were performed automatically. During the first two stages the 5 best structures were automatically selected for the next step.

The intent of this work-package was to try and find some non-peptide mimics.

The generative part of the method is based on Jan Jensen's python GB-GA (https://github.com/jensengroup/GB-GA), but with a custom similarly metric that provides a smooth continuous scoring including chemical specificity between 3D structures. Each step of the GA evaluated 42 conformers (generated with open-babel, scored with RMSD) of the trial compound, then maximised the 3D chemical overlap of these conformers against the reference molecule in a single 3D pose. The highest conformer score was used in the GA. The algorithm takes approximately 5 cpu seconds per molecule, which is mostly linear in the number of conformers that are checked.

18145 separate GA streams with a population size of 50 and 100 generations were seeded with the MPro-XChem hits (i.e. all fragments) and the first 1000 molecules of ZINC, and scored with a purely electrostatic chemical similarity. The elite (highest scoring) structures from these runs were then used to seed a second round of 9525 GA streams, where the metric additionally included a score of vdW dispersion chemical specificity (scored at the best electrostatic match), where these multiple objectives were scalarised by taking a weighted geometric mean (electrostatic^0.8 * dispersion^0.2). So the molecules here are the best of ~138 million evaluated molecules, after 200 generations of evolution.

The final outputs were simply ranked by the scoring function, and approx. 30% discarded by a simple RDKIT 'problematic group' filter. Clearly the algorithm has been rather keen to put lots of heteroatoms (O,N,S) in place, in order to reproduce a chemical similarity to the peptide backbone. No analysis of stability was made. 

No chemist has adjusted or post-processed these structures. Clearly much is missing from the metric - and any suggestions on how to 'fix' a structure with some obviously problematic hetero atoms / groups would be greatly appreciated!

The generative part of the method is based on Jan Jensen's python GB-GA (https://github.com/jensengroup/GB-GA), but with a custom similarly metric that provides a smooth continuous scoring including chemical specificity between 3D structures. Each step of the GA evaluated 42 conformers (generated with open-babel, scored with RMSD) of the trial compound, then maximised the 3D chemical overlap of these conformers against the reference molecule in a single 3D pose. The highest conformer score was used in the GA. The algorithm takes approximately 5 cpu seconds per molecule, which is mostly linear in the number of conformers that are checked.

18145 separate GA streams with a population size of 50 and 100 generations were seeded with the MPro-XChem hits (i.e. all fragments) and the first 1000 molecules of ZINC, and scored with a purely electrostatic chemical similarity. The elite (highest scoring) structures from these runs were then used to seed a second round of 9525 GA streams, where the metric additionally included a score of vdW dispersion chemical specificity (scored at the best electrostatic match), where these multiple objectives were scalarised by taking a weighted geometric mean (electrostatic^0.8 * dispersion^0.2). So the molecules here are the best of ~138 million evaluated molecules, after 200 generations of evolution.

The final outputs were simply ranked by the scoring function, and approx. 30% discarded by a simple RDKIT 'problematic group' filter. Clearly the algorithm has been rather keen to put lots of heteroatoms (O,N,S) in place, in order to reproduce a chemical similarity to the peptide backbone. No analysis of stability was made. 

No chemist has adjusted or post-processed these structures. Clearly much is missing from the metric - and any suggestions on how to 'fix' a structure with some obviously problematic hetero atoms / groups would be greatly appreciated! These could then be easily re-scored, to see whether the metric still thought they were similar.

The reference structure was compound 35 from 2011Akaji, which is a tetrapeptide transition state mimic for SARS-CoV(-1), with an IC50 of 98 nM [1]. The intent of this work-package was to try and find some non-peptide mimics.

The generative part of the method is based on Jan Jensen's python GB-GA (https://github.com/jensengroup/GB-GA), but with a custom similarly metric that provides a smooth continuous scoring including chemical specificity between 3D structures. Each step of the GA evaluated 42 conformers (generated with open-babel, scored with RMSD) of the trial compound, then maximised the 3D chemical overlap of these conformers against the reference molecule in a single 3D pose. The highest conformer score was used in the GA. The algorithm takes approximately 5 cpu seconds per molecule, which is mostly linear in the number of conformers that are checked.

18145 separate GA streams with a population size of 50 and 100 generations were seeded with the MPro-XChem hits (i.e. all fragments) and the first 1000 molecules of ZINC, and scored with a purely electrostatic chemical similarity. The elite (highest scoring) structures from these runs were then used to seed a second round of 9525 GA streams, where the metric additionally included a score of vdW dispersion chemical specificity (scored at the best electrostatic match), where these multiple objectives were scalarised by taking a weighted geometric mean (electrostatic^0.8 * dispersion^0.2). So the molecules here are the best of ~138 million evaluated molecules, after 200 generations of evolution.

The final outputs were simply ranked by the scoring function, and approx. 30% discarded by a simple RDKIT 'problematic group' filter. Clearly the algorithm has been rather keen to put lots of heteroatoms (O,N,S) in place, in order to reproduce a chemical similarity to the peptide backbone. No analysis of stability was made.

I chose this method due to bitter experience in molecular design with both computational and machine learning approaches. Due to the exponentially large chemical configuration space, any attempt to optimise a metric with errors (such as docking) will lead to the selection of the much more numerous false-positives than a genuine hit. By constraining the design algorithm to mixing two known-valid molecules (the fragments from Diamond), you strongly bias the exploration of chemical space to plausible regions, while giving sufficient freedom for the algorithm to select arbitrary combinations that would not be considered by a human.

Due to the exponentially large chemical configuration space, any attempt to optimise a metric with errors (such as docking) will lead to the selection of the much more numerous false-positives than a genuine hit. By constraining the design algorithm to mixing two known-valid molecules (the fragments from Diamond), you strongly bias the exploration of chemical space to plausible regions, while giving sufficient freedom for the algorithm to select arbitrary combinations that would not be considered by a human.  

As the structures are two fused fragments, they are approaching the size of a drug-like molecule.

An acrylamide warhead was preferred over the chloroacetamide to reduce the reactivity of the electrophile. Fragment x1382 was modified by incorporating an acrylamide instead of the original warhead, and docked with CovDock-LO (Schrödinger, https://doi.org/10.1021/ci500118s) against Cys145 to obtain reference coordinates for warhead atoms. A library of ≈450k acrylamides was compiled from the Enamine REAL database. An Interaction Fingerprint (IFP) analysis on XChem hits highlighted four recurring ph4 features: an hydrophobic group in P2; an H-bond donor to E166-O; an H-bond acceptor to E166-N; an H-bond acceptor to H163-NE2. The hydrophobic feature in P2 was found to be the most frequent and was set as mandatory together with at least one of the three H-bond features for the constrained docking with rDock. Tethered and constrained HTVS by rDock was performed by allowing rotational and translational degree of freedom to a certain extent for warhead atoms in the reactive site. Dynamic Undocking (DUck, https://doi.org/10.1038/nchem.2660) was performed focusing on the H-bond established by best scoring rDock hits with any of the three ph4 residues. CovDock-LO was performed on the best scoring hits to obtain covalent docking poses.

This tripeptide matches the three amino acids at the angiotensin I C-terminus.

Pantoliano and coworkers speculated (in their 2004 publication on the crystallographic characterization of ACE2) that the conformational distortion induced in ACE2 by substrate binding (within the active site cleft) might be adequate to disfavor viral binding. They incidentally noted that ACE2 could operate on non-native substrates, and that catalytic efficiency processing angiotensin I was orders of magnitude less than that of angiotensin II, despite good binding. This may imply that simple peptides may function as quasi-inhibitors.

To be clear, the goal here would be to induce the ""protected conformation"" of ACE2. This peptide is not intended to target viral proteins. (Fragment x0072 was arbitrarily selected just to be able to submit the form.)

If true, then perhaps simple digestion of protein could supply meaning levels of suitable peptides. This would suggest that diet may be a contributing factor to people's vastly differing levels of susceptibility to COVID-19. Otherwise, other modes of delivery could be considered (IV, aerosol).

Furthermore, it will be noted that the aliphatic component of chloroquine is similar to remdesivir, nitazoxanide, and a number of other small molecules believed to have in vitro efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. This structure may actually fit well within what Pantoliano and coworkers called the ""Try510 lid"" of ACE2.

It occurred to me that the sizes of the HIT molecules and the placement of the functional groups were similar to commercial CNS antidepressants. My question was ""could such drugs work as antiviral agents?"" If so, use could be very quick. 

Taking Imipramine and converting the end group to an amide produced a molecule that, under superposition with HITs, produced a close match with their functional groups. The trans-gauche side-chain structure is the most stable conformer in solution. Hence I thought it was worth submitting at this early stage of participation.

Further modification could be removing one of the aromatic rings. I have submitted a .pdb file but not as a ""bound"" structure. I do not have this capability at the moment but will do soon.

The QED score for each generated molecule was computed, and the top 1,000 generated molecules according to QED score were kept. Any generated molecules that were identical to the submissions were discarded during generation. Also, the Tanimoto similarity of each generated molecule was computed against each submission and fragment molecule, and any generated molecule with a Tanimoto similarity >= 0.9 was discarded during generation. The generated compounds generally had low average Tanimoto similarity to the submission and fragment compounds. This set of 1,000 generated molecules was combined with a set of 1,018 molecules generated on a previous date (using a different language model).

Each of the 2,018 generated molecules were then submitted to docking with the SARS-CoV-2 apo-MPro protein structure from the 6YB7_model.pdb file (provided by Diamond Light Source), using AutoDock Vina, with an exhaustiveness value of 16. Docking was focused on the active site. The molecules with a best mode binding energy of -7.9 kcal/mol or less were kept, resulting in 30 candidates. These 30 molecules were then docked once again, but using an exhaustiveness value of 256. Docking was repeated 3 times for each of the candidates. Also, the Synthetic Accessibility (SA) score was calculated for each candidate, as well as a toxicity estimate using the ProTox-II web service. A final weighted score was computed for each candidate using the normalized mean Vina best mode binding energy (50%), the QED score (20%), the normalized SA score (20%), and the normalized estimated LD50 (10%).

Also, the Tanimoto similarity of each generated molecule was computed against each submission molecule, and any generated molecule with a Tanimoto similarity >= 0.9 was removed (generated compounds generally had low average Tanimoto similarity to the submission compounds). Each generated molecule was then converted into SDF format using RDKit, and subsequently converted from SDF to PDB and PDBQT formats using Open Babel. Next, the SARS-CoV-2 apo-Mpro protein structure from the 6YB7_model.pdb file (provided by Diamond Light Source) was converted to PDBQT format.

Due to the known flexibility of SARS-CoV(-2) Mpro,[1,2]  two crystal structures were selected from the PDB to provide different overall active site geometries, 6Y2E and 6Y2G [3]. These and eleven more Mpro structures [4] from the PDB were overlaid so as to determine active site residues displaying the largest degree of disorder which were then used to define flexible side chains for inclusion in the docking calculations.

Virtual docking was performed with Autodock Vina [5] using protein and MBC compound structures prepared using MGLtools [6] and OpenBabel [7]. Docking was performed against both crystal structures with/without flexible active site side chains.

The top 20 compounds were selected based on their docking scores. The top 12 are predicted to be absorbed gastrointestinally and cross the blood-brain barrier and the next 8 are only predicted to be absorbed gastrointestinally.

Together with Dr Bruce Milne, University of Coimbra, Portugal (Bruce Milne bfmilne@gmail.com), we modelled this family of compounds into the two available SARS-CoV(-2) structures. Due to the known flexibility of SARS-CoV(-2) Mpro,[1,2]  two crystal structures were selected from the PDB to provide different overall active site geometries, 6Y2E and 6Y2G [3]. These and eleven more Mpro structures [4] from the PDB were overlaid so as to determine active site residues displaying the largest degree of disorder which were then used to define flexible side chains for inclusion in the docking calculations.

Virtual docking was performed with Autodock Vina [5] using protein and MBC compound structures prepared using MGLtools [6] and OpenBabel [7]. Docking was performed against both crystal structures with/without flexible active site side chains. The best compounds were selected based on overall docking scores and predicted bioavailability.[8]

The top 20 compounds were selected based on their docking scores. The top 12 are predicted to be absorbed gastrointestinally and cross the blood-brain barrier and the next 8 are only predicted to be absorbed gastrointestinally. Given difficulties in obtaining solvents right now, we will weigh requisite amounts into glass vials and ship them to Anthony Aimon at Diamond.

The compound was highly stable and makes several consistent interactions with the binding site residues throughout the simulation, such as:
1. The pyridine N makes a very strong hydrogen bond with nearby His163 sidechain.
2. The same pyridine creates an aromatic interaction environment with nearby aromatic residues, His163 and His172.
3. The terminal amino group on pyridine ring, on the virtue of being protonated at physiological pH, makes a salt-bridge interaction with negatively-charged Glu166.
4. The same terminal amino group on pyridine ring, also makes a hydrogen bond with side-chain amide group of Asn142. 
5. One of the carbonyl oxygens on the middle dipyrimidone-like ring makes the pivotal hydrogen bond interaction with backbone of His164. 
6. The other carbonyl oxygen on the dipyrimidone-like ring could make a very likely interaction with backbone of Gly149, as this is present on a very long and flexible loop. The primary reason of making the dipyrimidone was to constrain the orientation of the molecule and connect different pieces of molecule.
7. The fused phenyl group of dipyrimidone-like entity provides critical aromatic interaction with aromatic residue His41.
8. The imidazole also makes a highly favorable aromatic interaction with side-chain of His41, along with a hydrogen bond between imidazole NH and N of His41.
9. The N-sulphonamide =O makes a hydrogen bond with backbone of Thr26, along with several hydrogen bonds with a network of waters.

Picked the three fragments that seemed to fit best and suggest an overlapping bicycle in the centre, where I decided to include a thiophene as this S - SH appeared to possibly be an important interaction with Cys145.  These were fragments X0387, X0104, X0434.  X072 and X195 were also shortlisted.  Some tweaks were made due to the pharmacophore, e.g. the pyrimidine and the imidazole were added.  I removed a nitrogen from the non-aromatic ring to avoid incorporating a charge but this could be added back in.

In the fragment screen, many fragments bound in this location, with a hydrogen bond between the ligand and the epsilon nitrogen of HIS163. There are three examples of fragments with a 3-pyridine moiety (x0107, x0434, and x0678) and an additional closely related fragment with a pyrimidine (x0995). The pattern is obsured a little bit with other functional groups (i.e. x0426 and x0540 with 4-pyridine, and x0967 with a phenol) distracting from the 3-pyridine motif. For example, the 4-pyridine fragments could be useful except that the side groups extend into the solvent, making the 3-pyridine the preferred binding motif. x0995 presents an example fragment with an aniline-NH2 group in a beneficial location, a highly polar region where the N-terminal SER1 from chain B interacts with ASP142 and the backbone of PHE140. Also, x1093 offers an example of a larger ring system for increasing the surface contact area and the potential for additional polar and/or hydrogen bonding interactions to further increase the affinity of a piece of the drug molecule at this region of the binding pocket.

Another interesting feature of this fragment screen is the similarity of binding pose between x0678 and x0434.

Ideally, all of these compounds could be tested and the best candidates carried forward for modifications and growth on the conserved ends of these molecules.","x0107,x0434,x0678,x0995,x1093",https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/SID-ELM-8b394441,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,298.733,3.927200000000002,2,3,66.91,0,PASS,2-halo pyridine,PASS,Filter94_2_halo_pyridine,2-chloropyridine,2-halopyridine,PASS,"halo-pyridine,_-diazoles_and_-triazoles",PASS,QPKAUQNPUPGBKL,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

To enable this, we used Cyclica’s Ligand Design™  (LD), a flexible machine learning for identifying molecules that best satisfy a defined objective function. Briefly, LD traverses a chemical space iteratively by repeatedly deriving new molecules (children) from previous selections (parents) and then filtering them with respect to one or more objective functions. This optimization process proceeds until convergence, when no better molecules can be found. Ligand Design has multiple options for traversing chemical space, including fixed library screening (10^6 molecules evaluated), rule-based semi-generative approaches (~10^10 molecules represented), and fully generative options (~10^120 molecule possibilities). Importantly, for this design challenge, we used the semi-generative option for LD (that was developed with support from our Partners at Enamine), which efficiently traverses the Enamine REAL Space of molecules to identify promising molecules with high synthetic accessibility. 

For this design challenge, we applied two major selective pressures (objective functions). The first optimizes for compatibility with the 3CLpro binding site using Cyclica’s MatchMaker Deep Learning proteome-screening engine (white paper here: https://tinyurl.com/wx3yg64). MatchMaker has been found to be far more accurate than molecular docking, and is also several orders of magnitude more computationally efficient. The second is a ligand-based model consisting of all active fragments coming from the XChem screen. This model was created using our POEM technology (https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04555), a parameter-free supervised learning algorithm that utilizes multiple fingerprints simultaneously for improved predictive performance. Incorporation of this POEM model pressures LD to evolve molecules which resemble the fragment set (and prioritizes the molecules with higher occupancy in the crystal structures). Additional filters ensure that all molecules evaluated have ‘drug-like’ physicochemical properties and exclude problematic functional groups.  

Cyclica’s Ligand Design was applied using default parameters, allowing the optimization to proceed until convergence. The resulting process automatically defined a total of 106 ‘top molecules’ on the basis of proteome screening ranks. Among these top molecules, 35 ranked the corona virus protease compatibility higher than any human protein (~8000 present in the screen). A semi-manual curation process was applied to the 106 to prioritize molecules for submission. The first three were selected on the basis of having substructures with exact matches to hits from the XChem fragment screen. Next, we clustered the remaining top molecules using a multiple fingerprint approach and selected the 10 cluster exemplars for a total of 13 submissions. Any positive hits among cluster exemplars would merit subsequent investigation of the remaining cluster members.  

Note, For this submission Cyclica’s Ligand Design was used in its default state with no algorithmic customization or further optimizations to strictly enforce the presence of select fragments. We are open to further customizing this LD design process in subsequent design iterations, in order to incorporate the the expert insights of medicinal chemists involved in this project.","x0072,x0161,x0995",https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/VIJ-CYC-1a381570,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,527.4370000000001,4.2999000000000045,2,6,110.8,0,PASS,PASS,PASS,Filter9_metal,"carbamate, T-boc Protected, carbamate include di-substitued N, aryl bromide","Ester, Long aliphatic chain, Hetero_hetero",PASS,PASS,PASS,ZBMPZINAOLTBQI,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

To enable this, we used Cyclica’s Ligand Design™  (LD), a flexible machine learning for identifying molecules that best satisfy a defined objective function. Briefly, LD traverses a chemical space iteratively by repeatedly deriving new molecules (children) from previous selections (parents) and then filtering them with respect to one or more objective functions. This optimization process proceeds until convergence, when no better molecules can be found. Ligand Design has multiple options for traversing chemical space, including fixed library screening (10^6 molecules evaluated), rule-based semi-generative approaches (~10^10 molecules represented), and fully generative options (~10^120 molecule possibilities). Importantly, for this design challenge, we used the semi-generative option for LD (that was developed with support from our Partners at Enamine), which efficiently traverses the Enamine REAL Space of molecules to identify promising molecules with high synthetic accessibility. 

For this design challenge, we applied two major selective pressures (objective functions). The first optimizes for compatibility with the 3CLpro binding site using Cyclica’s MatchMaker Deep Learning proteome-screening engine (white paper here: https://tinyurl.com/wx3yg64). MatchMaker has been found to be far more accurate than molecular docking, and is also several orders of magnitude more computationally efficient. The second is a ligand-based model consisting of all active fragments coming from the XChem screen. This model was created using our POEM technology (https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04555), a parameter-free supervised learning algorithm that utilizes multiple fingerprints simultaneously for improved predictive performance. Incorporation of this POEM model pressures LD to evolve molecules which resemble the fragment set (and prioritizes the molecules with higher occupancy in the crystal structures). Additional filters ensure that all molecules evaluated have ‘drug-like’ physicochemical properties and exclude problematic functional groups.  

Cyclica’s Ligand Design was applied using default parameters, allowing the optimization to proceed until convergence. The resulting process automatically defined a total of 106 ‘top molecules’ on the basis of proteome screening ranks. Among these top molecules, 35 ranked the corona virus protease compatibility higher than any human protein (~8000 present in the screen). A semi-manual curation process was applied to the 106 to prioritize molecules for submission. The first three were selected on the basis of having substructures with exact matches to hits from the XChem fragment screen. Next, we clustered the remaining top molecules using a multiple fingerprint approach and selected the 10 cluster exemplars for a total of 13 submissions. Any positive hits among cluster exemplars would merit subsequent investigation of the remaining cluster members.

To guarantee synthetic accessibility, similar compounds within Enamine REAL space were searched using FTrees, based on the most promising compounds (estimated affinity and visual inspection). The so found compounds (no duplicates in current postera submissions, 31.03.2020) were clustered to find a diverse subset and the remaining compounds were redocked using SeeSAR. Based on the fit and the estimated binding affinity (and no tox. predictions (CPs) in eMolTox webserver), the five molecules were selected.

In other coronaviruses, e.g. SARS-CoV, these termini regions were shown to play an important role in protease activity and dimerization.(1,2) This idea here presented consists in merging these two fragments to explore distinct networks of hydrogen bonds and a pi-pi stacking with Phe8. A minimized complex with this new proposed ligand in MPro is available (attached). It shows hydrogen bonds with the backbone of Met6, T-shaped pi-pi interactions with Phe8 and a cation-pi interaction between the phenyl ring of the molecule and Arg298. This would provide a lead compound for Mpro inhibition, with significant room for ligand optimization.
Methodology: An initial visual inspection identified the pocket of MPro_x1086 and MPro_x1187 among the very few outside of the protease activity pocket of MPro that is not fully solvent exposed, and therefore it provides room for ligand optimization. MPro_x1086 forms a unique hydrogen bond with the backbone of Met6, and its phenyl group forms a pi-pi interaction with Phe8. Furthermore, its –NH2 group is close enough to the side chain of Asp295, raising the possibility of additional H-bonds. MPro_x1187 also forms pi-pi stacking with Phe8, while its amide group is not very far from Asn299. Therefore, a hybrid molecule consisting of these two fragments was built, and further minimized in MPro.

This proposal consists on designing compounds that mimic interactions of fragments x1086 and x1187 and are able to form a covalent bond with Cys300.
Methodology: The previously identified non-covalent binder of Mpro was modified by introducing a reactive nitrile group in its side chain. Then, this compound was docked to Mpro using the CovDock tool in Schrodinger, and selecting Cys300 as the reactive residue. Although most docking poses had an exposed sulfonamide group, we identified a conformation that was able to mimic interactions observed in the crystal structure of Mpro bound to x1086, i.e. a p-p interaction with Phe8 and hydrogen bond interactions with the backbone of Met6. The non-aromatic 5-membered ring of our previously designed compound was not making favorable interactions with its surrounding residues, and therefore it was removed. Addition of a morpholine group was done aiming at occupying a similar site as observed in the crystal structure of x1187. A further addition of a cyclopropane (or methyl groups) was aimed at improving PK properties, as previously observed for other cysteine protease inhibitors(1).
